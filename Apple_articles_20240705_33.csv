iPhone 17 'Slim': Everything We Know So Far,247,0.79,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/,"In 2025, Apple is expected to discontinue the iPhone ""Plus"" device in its iPhone 17 lineup to make way for an iPhone ""Slim"" – although it may not actually be called this when it debuts in the fall of next year. Even though the iPhone 16 series launch is still over two months away, when you consider that we learned about larger displays on the iPhone 16 Pro models way back in May 2023, rumors about a two-generations-away iPhone isn't all that unusual so far ahead of time.  While we await this year's iPhone 16 series, here's a compilation of everything we have heard from reputable sources so far about Apple's so-called iPhone 17 ""Slim.""  iPhone 17 Slim: Rumors So Far Thinner Design According to The Information, Apple's all-new iPhone 17 model next year will have a ""significantly thinner"" design with an aluminum chassis, rather than a titanium casing like Apple's Pro models. The news outlet also claims that the device will feature a narrower Dynamic Island, potentially due to Apple's adoption of a smaller ""metalens"" for the Face ID system. Internally code-named D23, the device's redesign has been described as a major one equivalent to the iPhone X. Smaller Display The first details about the size of the device's display arrived courtesy of Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu, who said it would be 6.6 inches. However, according to Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst Ross Young, it will feature a 6.55-inch display. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Plus has a 6.7-inch display. Apple is still said to be testing different designs for the slimmer phone, so the display size could always change between now and the device's launch. Relocated Cameras The Information claimed that the iPhone 17 ""Slim"" will have cameras in locations we haven't seen before on an iPhone. According to a May report, the rear cameras could be moved to the ""top center"" of the device. Some Android phones like Google's Pixel 8 Pro have rear cameras in a top-center position, but Apple's iPhone camera system has occupied the top-left corner ever since the 2007 model.  Anti-Reflective Coating All iPhone 17 models will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on iPhone 15 models, according to Chinese Weibo leaker Instant Digital. The outer glass on the iPhone 17 series is said to have a ""super-hard anti-reflective layer"" that is ""more scratch-resistant."" It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning's latest technology matches the rumor. ProMotion Technology According to The Elec, all iPhone 17 models will feature OLED displays with low-power backplane technology, bringing ProMotion to Apple's non-Pro iPhone models for the first time. ProMotion allows the display to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when required. ProMotion also allows the display to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, which is why the iPhone 15 Pro screens feature an always-on capability that shows the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked. Improved Selfie Camera According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the entire iPhone 17 lineup will feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera with a six-element lens. The iPhone 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements, and this year's iPhone 16 lineup is expected to feature the same hardware. The upgraded resolution on the iPhone 17 will allow photos to maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, while the larger number of pixels will capture finer details. The upgrade to a six-element lens should also slightly enhance image quality. Internal Upgrades Haitong analyst Jeff Pu claims the iPhone 17 ""Slim"" will feature 8GB of RAM, compared to 6GB of RAM on the iPhone 15 Plus. It's worth noting that all upcoming iPhone 16 models are expected to be fitted with 8GB of RAM – a hardware requirement of on-device Apple Intelligence. According to The Information, the device will also be equipped with Apple's A19 chip. Higher Price The Information reported that the slimmer iPhone 17 could have a higher price tag than the Pro Max model, which currently starts at $1,199, suggesting that the device would become the ew highest-end model in the lineup, bettering the iPhone 17 Pro Max. If that's the case, then perhaps the ""iPhone Slim"" will end up being the ""iPhone Ultra"" that has been rumored for several years. Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

Russia Forces Apple to Remove VPNs From App Store,307,0.93,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/07/04/russia-forces-apple-to-remove-vpns-from-app-store-a85608,"At least two VPN services said Thursday that Russian authorities have successfully forced Apple to delete their applications from its App Store in Russia. Identically worded messages from Apple’s app review team to Red Shield VPN and Le VPN state that their applications will be removed “per demand from Roskomnadzor.” Roskomnadzor is Russia’s state media watchdog. It has banned a number of Western social media platforms and blacklisted opposition media websites since the country invaded Ukraine in 2022. Roskomnadzor has also attempted to restrict VPNs with efforts ranging from voluntary inclusion in a state-approved white list to blocking them directly. An increasing number of VPNs have been blocked in Russia, with experts saying fewer services are now able to circumvent restrictions. The regulator demanded Apple remove the two VPNs because they include unspecified “content that is illegal in Russia,” according to the screenshots of emails published by Le VPN and Red Shield VPN. Le VPN said it has appealed the decision with Roskmonadzor and begun collaborating with other VPNs and rights activists to assess its implications. “This recent development underscores a significant escalation in Roskomnadzor’s capabilities, demonstrating its increasing influence over major technology companies like Apple,” Le VPN said in a statement. “The outcome of this incident could have far-reaching effects on how global tech companies operate in jurisdictions with stringent regulatory environments, influencing both business operations and user access to digital resources,” it said. Red Shield VPN recommended users change their Apple ID’s region or country settings to regain access.  On March 1, Roskomnadzor gained the power to block websites for informing readers on how to access prohibited resources and advocating or selling circumvention technologies like VPNs. Experts say this will further affect the ability of users to learn about and download VPNs amid Russia’s tightening wartime censorship rules. … we have a small favor to ask.

Apple's Game Porting Toolkit can now port macOS games to iOS,925,0.96,https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/03/apple-game-porting-macos-games-ios/,"Apple last year introduced a new Game Porting Toolkit to help developers bring their Windows games to macOS. Since then, we’ve seen some AAA titles coming to the Mac – and soon it will be even easier to port these games to iOS. That’s because Game Porting Toolkit 2.0 works not only on the Mac, but also on the iPhone and iPad. For those unfamiliar, Apple’s Game Porting Toolkit is capable of translating Windows games so that they run natively on macOS. Developers can use this tool to evaluate whether it’s worth porting their games to the Mac, and then work on optimizations for the macOS version of the game – this includes converting DirectX graphics to Metal. The SDK also helps developers take advantage of other built-in system features, such as support for game controllers, Spatial Audio, and HDR video. With macOS Sequoia, Apple is introducing Game Porting Toolkit 2 with a series of improvements and new options. For instance, the new version has better graphics performance and compatibility with more software. It also works with ray-tracing on compatible hardware and features the AVX2 instruction set. But surely the biggest news here is that Apple’s Game Porting Toolkit now works with iOS 18 too. In one of the WWDC 2024 sessions, the company talked about how developers can now use Game Porting Toolkit to port a Windows game to macOS and then port the macOS version to iPhone and iPad. When a developer optimizes their game for macOS, it can easily be ported to iOS. That’s because the SDK shares things like support for game controllers, audio and graphics. For example, the vibrations implemented for game controllers can be easily replicated with the iPhone’s Haptic Engine using the same API. This will certainly make Apple’s platforms a bit more appealing to game developers, as they’ll be able to port their titles to multiple devices with little effort. Apple’s Game Porting Toolkit 2 is now available as a beta for developers. More details can be found here. iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will be released to the public this fall.

Leak Confirms Apple's Work On 'Home Accessory',781,0.95,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/leak-confirms-apples-work-on-home-accessory/,"Code discovered on Apple's backend by MacRumors confirms Apple is indeed working on a long-rumored home accessory in addition to the HomePod and Apple TV. The code references a device with the identifier ""HomeAccessory17,1,"" which is a new identifier category. The name is similar to the ‌HomePod‌'s ""AudioAccessory"" identifier. Interestingly, the 17,1 in the identifier name suggests that this device may receive Apple's upcoming A18 chip, which will be used in all four iPhone 16 models later this year. With the A18 chip, the HomeAccessory device would have the power for Apple Intelligence.  The code also indicates that this ""home accessory"" will be running a software variant of tvOS, much like the ‌HomePod‌. Earlier this year, MacRumors found evidence of Apple's work on homeOS, which could be the firmware running on this device. On a similar note, the code also references two unreleased ‌Apple TV‌ models with the identifiers AppleTV14,4 and AppleTV14,5. Rumors suggest that an updated ‌Apple TV‌ could launch in 2024. Apple is expected to announce new iPhones, iPads, and potentially other products in September. (Thanks Nicolás Alvarez!) Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

Apple M5 Chip's Dual-Use Design Will Power Future Macs and AI Servers,779,0.96,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/apple-m5-chips-advanced-packaging-tsmc/,"Apple will reportedly use a more advanced SoIC packaging technology for its M5 chips, as part of a two-pronged strategy to meet its growing need for silicon that can power consumer Macs and enhance the performance of its data centers and future AI tools that rely on the cloud. Developed by TSMC and unveiled in 2018, SoIC (System on Integrated Chip) technology allows for the stacking of chips in a three-dimensional structure, providing better electrical performance and thermal management compared to traditional two-dimensional chip designs.  According to the Economic Daily, Apple has expanded its cooperation with TSMC on a next-generation hybrid SoIC package that additionally combines thermoplastic carbon fiber composite molding technology. The package is said to be in a small trial production phase, with the intention of mass producing the chips in 2025 and 2026 for new Macs and AI cloud servers. References to what are believed to be Apple's M5 chip have already been discovered in official Apple code. Apple has been working on processors for its own AI servers made with TSMC's 3nm process, targeting mass production by the second half of 2025. However, according to Haitong analyst Jeff Pu, Apple's plans in late 2025 are to assemble AI servers powered by its M4 chip. Currently, Apple's AI cloud servers are believed to be running on multiple connected M2 Ultra chips, which were originally designed solely for desktop Macs. Whenever the M5 is adopted, its advanced dual-use design is believed to be a sign of Apple future-proofing its plan to vertically integrate its supply chain for AI functionality across computers, cloud servers, and software.

ChatGPT Mac App Stored User Chats in Plain Text Prior to Latest Update,719,0.84,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/chatgpt-mac-app-stored-chats-plain-text/,"OpenAI has issued an update to its ChatGPT app for Mac, after a developer discovered the app was locally storing users' conversations with the chatbot in plain text. Pedro José Pereira Vieito told The Verge's Jay Peters: ""I was curious about why OpenAI opted out of using the app sandbox protections and ended up checking where they stored the app data.""  That led Pereira Vieito to develop ""ChatGPTStealer,"" a simple app to demonstrate how easy it is to load the chats in a text window outside of the ChatGPT app. After successfully trying out the app for himself, Peters said he was also able to see the text of conversations on his computer just by changing the file name, indicating the extent of the privacy risk. The ChatGPT Mac app is available solely through OpenAI's website, which is why it has not been obligated to follow Apple's sandboxing requirements that apply to software distributed via the Mac App Store. The oversight basically meant any other running app or process could potentially access the ChatGPT conversations without prompting the user for permission.

After The Verge contacted OpenAI about the issue, the company released an update that it says encrypts the chats. ""We are aware of this issue and have shipped a new version of the application which encrypts these conversations,"" OpenAI spokesperson Taya Christianson told the website. ""We're committed to providing a helpful user experience while maintaining our high security standards as our technology evolves."" After downloading the update (v1.2024.171), Pereira Vieito's app no longer works, and Peters said he was no longer able to see his conversations with the chatbot in plain text.
