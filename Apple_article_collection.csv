Previous rumors have said that the whole iPhone 17 range will boast an LTPO display, meaning that they will get the ProMotion screen that provides a faster, more responsive display. Those rumors did specifically say that the iPhone 17 Plus would be getting this screen, and the existence of the Plus model has been repeated. Now leaker ""Ice Universe"" on Weibo, who has a good track record for iPhone display details, has released a series of specifications and prices for the iPhone 17 range. The leak backs up the use of LTPO screens, except for one model marked as being the iPhone SE 4, which will have the older LTPS displays. Leaker ""Ice Universe"" has published a specifications and price list for the iPhone 17 range The leak claims that the iPhone 17 will have a 6.27-inch LTPO screen, seemingly the same as the iPhone 17 Pro.

That model is said to have a 6.65-inch LTPO display and cost from $1,299. This may be the ""Ultra"" model that has been rumored for several generations. According to the leak, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will have 12GB of RAM and a triple 48MP camera system. They will reportedly feature a 3nm A19 Pro chip, while the regular models will have an A19. Another advantage of the regular iPhones getting a ProMotion screen is that it should mean they get an always-on display.

Apple,"iOS 17.6 coming soon for iPhone users, here’s what’s new so far",https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/21/ios-17-6-coming-soon/,"Apple is preparing to imminently release iOS 17.6, which will come with the build number 21G79. iOS 17.6 has been light on features throughout the beta period, so presumably this version will primarily include bug fixes and improvements. The information was shared on social media by a private account with a strong track record. The account has previously shared details about upcoming iOS software updates on multiple different occasions. This news comes shortly after the account claimed that iOS 17.5.2 was ‘scrapped’, presumably to make way for this release instead. Apple started beta testing iOS 17.6 shortly after the first developer beta of iOS 18, and so far the only known feature seems to be a new ‘Catch Up’ feature in the Apple TV app for MLS Season Pass viewers. This feature allows you to catch up on the game if you joined late, by providing a series of highlights for you to watch. As we approach the release of iOS 18, these new iOS 17 releases will remain light. For a quick refresher, iOS 18 will be available later this fall for iPhone XS/XR users and later, and it’ll include a number of new features, such as the ability to place app icons wherever you want on your home screen, new dark and tinted app icon options, Apple Intelligence for compatible devices, and more.

Apple,Could our Macs be CrowdStruck?,https://eclecticlight.co/2024/07/22/could-our-macs-be-crowdstruck/,"Thankfully, Macs weren’t affected by last week’s catastrophic CrowdStrike bug, but several of you have asked me whether macOS could be affected by something similar in the future. The short answer is that’s becoming increasingly unlikely, and for Apple silicon Macs in particular is no longer a significant risk. To understand why this is so, we need to know what happened to Windows systems with CrowdStrike protection installed, and how macOS differs. CrowdStrike’s own account of the bug states that “an operating system crash” occurred as the result of a single logic error in one of many configuration files, known as Channel Files, that control the security protection provided by CrowdStrike’s Falcon sensor. That in turn led to the infamous Blue Screen of Death, or BSOD, the method used by Windows to inform the user that a kernel panic has occurred and the PC needs to reboot. Those configuration files are apparently automatically updated “several times a day”, without any user interaction or notification, in a long-established process used by CrowdStrike. Researchers are currently discussing the exact point of failure and how it was able to have such serious consequences. For a single logic error to result in a kernel panic and the BSOD, it’s almost certain that the Falcon sensor runs with elevated privileges as a Kernel-Mode Driver, roughly equivalent to a kernel extension (kext) in macOS. It doesn’t seem credible that the Falcon sensor running with only user privileges would be able to bring the whole of Windows down in this way. The macOS version of the Falcon sensor uses a kernel extension (kext) on Intel Macs prior to Big Sur, but because of the limitations of kexts on Apple silicon, it now uses an endpoint security System Extension instead. Apple deprecated kexts years ago, and they can only be used on Apple silicon Macs if their startup security is dropped to Reduced Security and third-party kexts are explicitly allowed to load. For a vendor selling into enterprise and organisations, that requirement would be unacceptable to customers. As a result, almost all apps that used to use kexts have switched to modern System Extensions and their relatives. Those run with normal user privileges, so if they do go badly wrong shouldn’t be able to cause a kernel panic. They’re also designed to be installed and removed using the app that relies on them. If there’s a bug in a System Extension, you should be able to open its app and remove or update it from there. When CrowdStrike for macOS started using a System Extension nearly four years ago, it even proclaimed that “reducing the need for privileged access is always a more secure approach and we are proud to embrace this new architecture.” Apple’s road from kexts to System Extensions has been long, controversial, and only succeeded when Apple silicon Macs couldn’t use kexts without being run at Reduced Security. The devastation wrought by the CrowdStrike bug is vindication for all the pain that deprecation brought. Where macOS remains at risk is with Apple’s own updates. Little more than eight years ago, on 26 February 2016, a silent automatic update to the macOS Incompatible Kernel Extension Configuration Data came close to breaking most Macs of the day. That list blocks old and incompatible kexts from being run, and version 3.28.1 inadvertently included one of Apple’s own kexts, that responsible for operating the Ethernet port on many Macs, including the latest models of iMacs and MacBook Pros at the time. That didn’t cause a kernel panic, but once all those Macs had updated to the new version and restarted, their Ethernet ports vanished and couldn’t be used. That brought two serious problems: as the Ethernet port has been widely used to identify individual Macs, many apps were unable to run, and those without the fallback of WiFi networking were isolated from the Internet, so couldn’t download and install the emergency update that Apple released to fix the defective file. Both Apple and macOS have come a long way since that happened in El Capitan. Although we all moan about bugs in macOS, quality control of macOS and security data updates has improved considerably, and updates have become much more consistent and reliable as a result of the Signed System Volume. The transition to Apple silicon is also simplifying testing and support with their more consistent hardware, compared to the gamut of different components used in Intel Macs. As Rosyna Keller has written, this catastrophe wasn’t Microsoft’s fault but it is Microsoft’s problem. It’s a problem that Apple has addressed, and Microsoft has a lot to answer for in not making Windows more robust in the way that macOS is now. I suspect plenty of folk in Apple are feeling rather smug. Thank you Howard! This article, albeit indirectly, illuminates many of your other articles in which you talk about security, and I finally understood the manoeuvres Apple made that I didn’t understand the real purpose of.I now also understand why, at some point, OCLP, in order to solve the inability to run unsupported Macs with Ventura and Sonoma, had to put some KEXTs (in my case those of the nVidia Kepler series video card) in /Library/Extensions/ and no longer in System/Library/Extensions/ as it had always been previously.

Apple,Apple's New DAC Patent Promises Flawless Sound Quality on All Apple Devices by Eliminating One Thing,https://www.headphonesty.com/2024/07/apple-patent-dacs-promises-sound-quality/,"We independently review all our recommendations. Purchases made via our links may earn us a commission. Learn more ❯ Apple might have just solved a decades-old DAC problem with this new technology. Apple has secured a patent for a new digital-to-analog converter (DAC) technology that could make sound much better in future devices. Using “static alternating fill order” (AFO) logic, this tech aims to eliminate the gain gradient errors causing distortions in current DAC designs. Apple’s new idea fixes a problem that’s been in DAC designs since their inception. Traditional DACs rely on an array of unit cells to convert digital signals to analog. But, not all cells are created equal. Their physical layout means some cells do more work than others, which adds small distortions that make the audio less pure. Apple’s solution? A DAC with a fractal layout and a clever bit of logic they’re calling “alternating fill order” (AFO). This system works like a careful conductor, controlling how the unit cells turn on in a well-planned way. As the signal gets stronger, the AFO logic balances out the individual quirks of each cell, resulting in a cleaner sound. Basically, Apple’s patent focuses on improving conversion accuracy by addressing the issue of gain gradient errors in DACs. This can be implemented in two forms: Our main goal in audio reproduction has always been to make it sound as close to the original recording as possible. And, this new DAC technology brings us close by minimizing errors in the conversion process. The result could be: It can also improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and help reduce differential nonlinearity (DNL) and integral nonlinearity (INL), which are critical factors in DAC performance. But Apple’s ambitions don’t stop at audio. For one, the design could also save power by turning off signals to branches that aren’t needed at a certain time. This DAC is also a speed demon, potentially operating at frequencies north of 10 GHz. That’s overkill for audio. But, it opens up a world of possibilities in wireless communication. Because of this, we could be looking at the core of future devices that push the limits of 5G and beyond. Apple’s approach is refreshingly novel when compared to conventional DAC designs in several ways. First, the fractal layout allows for more even signal paths, which could make it work faster and sync better. Second, the AFO logic adds another level of improvement, dealing with subtle variations that other designs often overlook. This uniformity fixes a common weakness in regular designs where signal path variations can introduce their own set of problems. Compared to traditional column and line DACs, Apple’s fractal design also makes it easier to spread out incoming data. This not only makes it work better but might also make the whole DAC smaller by reducing the need for exterior control logic. Plus, the versatility here is impressive. Whether it’s dealing with thermometric or binary coded unit cells, or handling multiple phases for complex signal processing, this DAC architecture has it covered. Patents don’t always translate directly into products. But, this technology could have far-reaching implications for Apple’s future lineup. With this, users might see improved performance in next-generation AirPods or HomePods. The iPhone, already a capable audio device, could also evolve into a pocket-sized recording studio. And, as Apple moves into new areas like augmented reality and car tech, this DAC could be key in creating truly immersive sound experiences. But this isn’t just about better-sounding gadgets; it’s about improving the whole field of signal processing. This DAC technology could be particularly useful for radio frequency (RF) signal generation, potentially improving performance in devices using 5G, Wi-Fi, LTE-LAA, and other wireless communication standards. This means we might see benefits across all of Apple’s products, from Macs and iPhones to iPads and Apple Watches. Comment * Name * Email *",2024-07-21
Apple,"The AirPods Max are getting left behind, so are new Apple headphones coming this year?",https://www.theverge.com/23755432/airpods-max-no-adaptive-audio-conversation-volume-features,"By Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. It was inevitable that despite their hefty $549 price, Apple’s AirPods Max headphones would eventually start to miss out on the company’s latest software enhancements. Headphones are basically computers now and have evolved into their own platform, so just like with any iPhone or Mac, Apple’s ecosystem tricks and new features increasingly require more powerful silicon and revamped components. We started to see the swan song for the two-and-a-half-years-old AirPods Max earlier this month at WWDC when Apple announced several new features coming this fall that, in nearly all cases, will exclusively apply to the second-generation AirPods Pro — and no other models. The headlining feature is called “Adaptive Audio,” a new sound mode that intelligently blends noise cancellation and transparency modes based on your surroundings. “You can stay present in your environment while distracting noises are automatically reduced,” Apple’s Ron Huang said during the keynote presentation. Adaptive Audio will generally muffle the outside world, but you’ll clearly hear certain sounds — bike bells, car horns, etc. — that are important for personal safety. Adaptive Audio builds upon the Adaptive Transparency mode that launched with the second-gen AirPods Pro. On those earbuds, Apple’s passthrough mode can quickly soften ear-piercing sounds like sirens and construction work. The company said this on-device processing was made possible by its H2 chip, which (so far) is only available in the latest AirPods Pro. The AirPods Max have an H1 chip in each ear cup, but apparently, that’s still not enough to make Adaptive Audio happen. Adaptive Audio promises some unique functionality, and I’m looking forward to testing it. But some of Apple’s other new audio features — again, all exclusive to the newest AirPods Pro — seem inspired by what we’ve seen from the earbud competition. Personalized Volume is another of those tricks announced at WWDC. Over time, the AirPods Pro will learn your volume preferences in different conditions and automatically try to keep the loudness right where you like it. This is an idea that Google pursued with past Pixel Buds, but the company ditched Adaptive Sound with the Pixel Buds Pro. Apple is very cognizant of hearing health, so I’d wager Personalized Volume will only crank your music up so far. And then there’s Conversation Awareness, which is a feature I’d argue Sony pioneered before other earbuds adopted the same concept. That said, Apple’s implementation sounds slightly more sophisticated than simply turning down the volume and flipping on transparency mode as soon as you start talking. Conversation Awareness lowers the music, sure, but Apple has said that it can “enhance the voices in front of the user, all while reducing background noise.” There’s a focus on isolating voice frequencies that isn’t present in other approaches to this I’ve tried so far. But again, the bad news for AirPods Max owners is that none of this new functionality is coming to Apple’s most premium headphones. They’re not being ignored completely; you’ll be able to quickly mute yourself on calls with the digital crown, and Apple has said the sometimes-unpredictable automatic device switching will be much more reliable after this fall’s round of software updates. But the most helpful upgrades aren’t coming. Even small conveniences like the shorter “Siri” activation word — no more “Hey” required — are only for the second-gen AirPods Pro. Ouch. Anecdotally, I’ve been seeing the AirPods Max everywhere lately. There are two people wearing them at the coffee shop where I’m writing this. I’m sure much of that momentum is owed to frequent retailer discounts, as it’s very easy to find sales on them at this point. Still, even with a discount, they are typically more expensive than many competitors. Either way, a lot of the time, they’re being used outdoors on busy city streets. Adaptive Audio would absolutely be a beneficial feature for this product. And why wouldn’t I want Conversation Awareness when wearing them at the office? You’re not going to see many complaints piling up during the summer beta cycle, but once these features roll out to everyone come September, I’d wager more than a few AirPods Max owners will be irked by what they’re missing out on — if they’re even aware of the new features at all. Will Apple really keep the current model around for another year (or more) and leave them stranded with fewer features compared to the AirPods Pro? Even right now, after hearing the WWDC announcements, I’d feel a bit ripped off walking into an Apple Store and spending $549 on headphones that have nearly hit the wall on new features. Rumors on the next AirPods Max have been few and far between. Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo doesn’t expect anything until the second half of 2024 or even later. That feels... very late. I’m hopeful we’ll see a new version of the company’s noise-canceling headphones this fall alongside the iPhone 15 lineup. The iPhone’s pending transition to USB-C opens the door to an “easy” AirPods Max refresh: Apple could swap out the Lightning port, upgrade the silicon to the more advanced H2 chip, and call it a day. I’d take that over nothing at all. The AirPods Pro are very likely to get a USB-C charging case, and that’ll probably be it until a third-gen set comes along. But I hope we’ll see something more than that for the AirPods Max. There’s no denying that for all their careful design considerations, Apple’s headphones are heavy and can get fatiguing over time. Hell, we’ve got people getting anxious about denting their heads nowadays. If the company can shave off some of that load, it could result in meaningful improvements to extended comfort. And then there’s the pitiful “case” that offers little in the way of actual protection for the premium cans. That could desperately use a do-over at some point. And as an audio fidelity nerd, I’m still dreaming of the day we get some sort of wireless Apple Lossless support. Not holding my breath for that last one, though. Longer battery life would be nice, seeing as companies like Sennheiser have lapped the playback time of the AirPods Max. It’s evident that Apple is calculated and deliberate when it comes to new AirPods hardware. The second-gen AirPods Pro look very similar to the originals — much to the chagrin of anyone who’d hoped to see new colors or a fresh design — but offer substantial improvements in sound quality, noise cancellation, transparency, and reliability. They haven’t suffered the crackling/static woes that often plagued the first pair. Noise cancellation quibbles aside, I’ve yet to see any common AirPods Max issues surface since the headphones were released. Apple is working from a solid (albeit very pricey) foundation. But as with any iPhone that’s come and gone over the years, we’re starting to see that the company’s headphones can only keep up with the latest software enhancements for so long. The open question is how long Apple will wait before bringing the AirPods Max back up to par. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Apple,Here’s everything you should know about Apple’s rumored HomePod with display,https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/20/homepod-display-rumor-roundup/,"After releasing the HomePod 2 in early 2023, there have been a number of rumors about a new HomePod model that includes some sort of display. These rumors have focused on two different ideas for what a HomePod with display would actually be. The more prevalent rumor is a more traditional smart display, and the other is a far more advanced table-top device with a robotic arm. According to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple’s smart display product is likely to include a 7-inch LCD display. This would make it similar to other products in the market, such as the Amazon Echo Show. The device would be good for FaceTime calls, controlling your smart home accessories, and interacting with Siri. 9to5Mac has discovered that Apple has been testing tvOS on the iPad mini in the past, suggesting that the company intends to use a similar screen size for the upcoming smart display product. While Kuo’s original report did mention a release date of early 2024, clearly that did not end up panning out. However, we’ve seen a number of references to this device within Apple beta software lately, so it’s likely that this device is around the corner. According to a sighting by MacRumors last month, an unreleased device called “HomeAccessory17,1” was spotted in backend code. This reference suggests that the device will be running a variation of the A18 chip, which will debut with the upcoming iPhone 16 models. If the upcoming HomePod with display sports an A18 chip, the device will likely support Apple Intelligence, which current HomePod models do not. This would be pretty big, since Siri takes a massive leap with Apple Intelligence, something that would be pretty important on a device you’d primarily interact with by speaking to it. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has also previously referred to a possibility of an “iPad-like smart display that could be magnetically attached to a wall”. This differs slightly from previous ideas, as it suggests that Apple could be working on a cheaper tablet of sorts, except it wouldn’t be running iPadOS. Gurman mentions magnetic wall mounts, but I could also see Apple building out an ecosystem of other accessories, one of which being a magnetic speaker dock, similar to the Google Pixel Tablet. Apple has long been rumored to be working on a new operating system called homeOS, with rumors going as far back as 2021. More recently, new references were found within tvOS 17.4 mentioning this “homeOS” branding. It’s not quite clear if homeOS is going to be an all-new operating system (although it’ll likely still be based on tvOS), or if it’ll just be a rebrand of tvOS. Either way, new HomePod products with screens will likely incorporate that branding in some way. Earlier this month, 9to5Mac found a new touch interface called “PlasterBoard” within tvOS 18 beta 3. PlasterBoard is still in its early days, but so far we’ve seen a new passcode screen, something that doesn’t exist on tvOS today. It’d likely make sense to have a proper Lock Screen on a product like the rumored HomePod with Display, as that’s meant to be a more personal device. After the cancellation of the Apple Car, Apple reportedly began shifting engineers to work on various home related robotic products, serving as the company’s “next big thing”. While the teams are also working on more advanced products, such as a “mobile robot that can follow users around their homes”, one of the products of focus has been a table-top robotics device with a display. In the past, Gurman has referred to this device as a “HomePod with a screen that swivels like a robotic arm”. According to the report from Bloomberg, the device would be able to mimic head movements of a user while on FaceTime, such as nodding. It’d also be able to lock onto a specific person in a crowd while on a call – thanks to its robotic arm. However, Apple is reportedly concerned about whether or not people would be willing to pay for such an advanced device. There have also been technical challenges with balancing the weight of the arm on such a small stand, and the company might not ultimately move forward with this type of product. After all, Apple has already created a similar feature with Center Stage, by using an Ultra Wide camera and zooming in on whoever is currently speaking, which would obviously be far more cost effective than a robotic arm. With the original $349 HomePod ultimately flopping, I think it makes more sense for Apple to take a budget approach with the HomePod with display, rather than releasing a cutting-edge device. Ultimately, theres a lot of varying ideas for what Apple’s HomePod with Display will end up looking like. However, we can say one thing for sure – Apple is definitely investing more into smart home products, and we’ll likely see some of their developments within the next year or so. Apple has also experimented with a HomePod with a circular LCD display on top, compared to the current array of LEDs that exists on the current generation HomePod. Although that product is unlikely to be a fully featured Smart Display like the other rumors mentioned earlier, the product – codenamed B720, is reportedly in advanced stages.

Apple,iPhone SE 4 Rumored to Use Same Rear Chassis as iPhone 16,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/19/iphone-se-4-likely-to-use-iphone-16-chassis/,"Apple will adopt the same rear chassis manufacturing process for the iPhone SE 4 that it is using for the upcoming standard iPhone 16, claims a new rumor coming out of China. According to the Weibo-based leaker ""Fixed Focus Digital,"" the backplate manufacturing process for the iPhone SE 4 is ""exactly the same"" as the standard model in Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 lineup, which is expected to be released in September. The iPhone SE 4, meanwhile, is expected to arrive in the spring. The latest claim casts doubt on a previous rumor suggesting Apple would use a modified iPhone 14 chassis as the basis for a fourth-generation iPhone SE. In November 2023, MacRumors learned from a source close to Apple's manufacturing process that the dimensions of the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 ""perfectly matched"" those of the base model ‌iPhone 14 in its current stage‌. While it's still unclear what may have led to the change, it's possible that Apple chose to adopt its newer rear chassis process for the more affordable SE model to achieve economy of scale at the point of production as the manufacture of iPhone 14 models winds down towards retirement. However, it could also indicate a change to the camera system on the fourth-generation iPhone SE. Unlike the ‌iPhone 14‌, the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 was previously rumored to include a single 48-megapixel rear camera with a custom backplate for the device to account for the design change. In contrast, for the iPhone 16 models, Apple is planning a new vertical camera lens arrangement that is a departure from the diagonal lens setup found on iPhone 15 models. The new orientation will presumably allow the standard iPhone 16 models to capture Spatial Video for the Vision Pro headset. Adopting the same backplate for the iPhone SE 4 would seem to suggest it will feature the same dual camera setup, although we haven't heard any rumors specifically claiming that this is in Apple's plans. Apple is said to be targeting a sub-$500 starting price for its fourth-generation iPhone SE model, despite a raft of rumored upgrades coming to the more affordable device. Touch ID and the Home button will be replaced by Face ID and a display notch, while the display size will increase from 4.7 inches to 6.1 inches. Other features expected for the next iPhone SE include a USB-C port and an Action button. The third-generation iPhone SE was released in March 2022, so there is likely pent-up demand for a new model that includes some of the latest features of Apple's flagship iPhone models.

Apple,"Crowdstrike Says Global IT Outage Limited to Windows PCs, But Mac and Linux Hosts Not Affected",https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/19/global-it-outage-limited-to-windows-pcs/,"A widespread system failure is currently affecting numerous Windows devices globally, causing critical boot failures across various industries, including banks, rail networks, airlines, retailers, broadcasters, healthcare, and many more sectors. The issue, manifesting as a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), is preventing computers from starting up properly and forcing them into continuous recovery cycles. The cause of the failure has been identified as an update to Crowdstrike Falcon antivirus software installed on Windows 10 PCs, but Mac and Linux machines running the same cybersecurity software have been spared. Crowdstrike, which specializes in endpoint security protection for corporate networks, has just released the following statement: ""Crowdstrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts. ""Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This is not a security incident or cyberattack. ""The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed. ""We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website. ""We further recommend organisations ensure they're communicating with Crowdstrike representatives through official channels. ""Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of Crowdstrike customers."" Unfortunately, the nature of the problem means that fixing it isn't as simple as installing a patch. The workaround to break the infinite boot cycle on affected Windows machines involves manually booting into safe mode, navigating to the CrowdStrike directory, and deleting the system file that caused the problem. As such, it could be a while before all services impacted by the content update are back up and running. For those who have a Windows machine that has succumbed to the botched update (now rolled back), Crowdstrike has outlined the following steps system admins need to take to get back up and running: As expected, Apple's system status webpage shows no issues with its services, however there have been scattered reports of problems with contactless payments across some businesses, which could prevent Apple Pay transactions from being processed.

Apple,Apple patent hints at new system to rank Wi-Fi networks in iOS,https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/16/apple-patent-rank-wi-fi-networks-ios/,"It’s been a while since iOS began warning iPhone and iPad users about the security of Wi-Fi networks in the Settings app depending on their password type. However, it seems that Apple wants to take this system to the next level, at least that’s what one of the company’s latest patents shows. The company has filed a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) demonstrating a new system for ranking public Wi-Fi networks based on multiple criteria (via The Mac Observer). Based on the patent description, Apple devices would collect data about Wi-Fi networks without identifying the user and their exact location. With this data, a system would map these Wi-Fi networks and their characteristics in order to “improve the efficiency of the interactions between user devices and the detected access points.” One of the patent illustrations gives us a better idea of how this new system would work. For example, iOS users would see labels such as High Quality, Popular, and Suspicious in the Settings app to describe a Wi-Fi network. The system would also prompt users if they want to connect to a popular Wi-Fi network available. Of course, it’s worth noting that Apple is always filing new patents and not all of them see the light of day. Even so, given that Apple is committed to privacy, it seems very likely that such a system will be implemented in the future to alert users as to whether a Wi-Fi network is reliable or not. What do you think of this idea? Let us know in the comments section below. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Apple,iOS 9 Beta Wallpaper,https://basicappleguy.com/haberdashery/ios-9-beta-wallpaper,"One of my favourite iOS wallpapers that never made it out of beta is available here for your iPhone, iPad, and Mac. When the iOS 9 beta was released in 2015, it featured a gorgeous and vibrant rolling wave wallpaper for iPad and iPhone. Mysteriously, in Beta 5, the wave wallpaper disappeared without a trace, replaced by a collection of more abstract-looking textured wallpapers apparently pulled from a NASA library showcasing the surface of Mars (okay, that's pretty cool). Those wallpapers were undeniably great, but I wanted to bring back an upscaled version of this long-lost gem of an iOS 9 Beta wallpaper. The image has been upscaled, slightly edited, and cropped to create a Mac wallpaper in addition to the iPad & iPhone versions. Enjoy! iPad | Mac | iPhone",2024-07-19
Apple,The DOJ’s assault on Apple will harm consumers,https://reason.com/2024/07/17/the-dojs-assault-on-apple-will-harm-consumers/,"Technology Rand Paul | 7.17.2024 6:30 AM In America, we do not punish businesses for their success. We certainly do not punish businesses because their competitors are struggling to keep pace. Sadly, that is exactly what the Department of Justice (DOJ) is attempting to do in its recent lawsuit against Apple. In March, the DOJ, joined by 15 states and the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit aimed at penalizing Apple for successfully competing in the market for smartphones. However, like much of the Biden administration's approach to antitrust enforcement, the DOJ's lawsuit is focused on punishing Apple for its success rather than addressing any real harm to consumers. Instead of fostering innovation and competition, this approach threatens to stifle the very progress that benefits Americans. In its lawsuit, the DOJ makes the unsubstantiated claim that Apple has ""willfully monopolized"" the smartphone market through ""exclusionary"" and ""anticompetitive"" conduct. In particular, it accuses Apple of exercising unwarranted control over the creation, distribution, and functioning of apps within the iPhone operating system. What the complaint ignores, however, is that this control is not simply a lawful business practice by a privately held company; it is an indispensable part of Apple's business model. Far from being an ""anticompetitive"" practice that harms consumers, Apple's careful approach to app integration is a pro-competitive way in which it meets its users' demands. Privacy, security, and seamless integration have been the core of Apple's operational strategy for years. Back in 2010, Steve Jobs explained that ""when selling to people who want their devices to just work, we think integrated wins every time."" That ""open systems don't always work,"" and Apple was ""committed to the integrated approach."" What makes Apple products so unique is their ease of use and consistency over time. While no product will ever be perfect, Apple's goal is to deliver a seamless, integrated experience that users can rely on time after time without giving it a second thought. How does Apple do this? By carefully exercising the very control that the DOJ is trying to punish. As economist Alex Tabarrok explains in Marginal Revolution: ""Apple's promise to iPhone users is that it will be a gatekeeper. Gatekeeping is what allows Apple to promise greater security, privacy, usability and reliability. Gatekeeping is Apple's brand promise. Gatekeeping is what the consumer's are buying."" This control is not a sign of anticompetitive conduct, quite the opposite. It is Apple's unique approach to third-party integration that differentiates it from other smartphone providers. As the Northern District of California found in the Epic Games v. Apple case, Apple's approach ""ultimately increases consumer choice by allowing users who value open distribution to purchase Android devices, while those who value security and the protection of a 'walled garden' to purchase iOS devices."" The DOJ's lawsuit is not actually about protecting consumers; iPhone users view Apple's careful integration as a feature of the platform, not a bug. Instead, it's a thinly veiled attempt to accomplish through litigation what Democrats could not get done through legislation. In 2022, the DOJ sent several sitting senators a letter in support of the American Innovation and Choice Online Act. This legislation was aimed at prohibiting many of the very consumer welfare–enhancing practices that the DOJ is now suing Apple over. The problem: it never passed. Why? Because it is extremely unpopular among American voters. A 2022 poll conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that ""70% of voters oppose Congressional proposals to add new antitrust regulations."" Even more, when reading descriptions of the policies included in the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, 79 percent of Republicans, 72 percent of independents, and 59 percent of Democrats said they would oppose the bill. In its lawsuit against Apple, the DOJ is trying to rehash these very same unpopular arguments that have already been rejected by the American people. Not only is this an egregious attempt to bypass the legislative process, it threatens to penalize innovation and reduce choice, ultimately harming the very people it claims to protect. Digital markets do not need more government regulation; they need more companies willing to innovate and compete. The DOJ should not waste taxpayer-provided resources targeting a company that has earned its success through excellence in the marketplace. An Apple a day may keep the doctor away, but it seems that all of the pro-competitive justifications in the world cannot keep a politically motivated antitrust enforcer at bay.

Learn more about when to upvote > Original post from South Korea Apple discussions. Apple launched the iPhone in South Korea in 2009, sparking the smartphone revolution. Since then, they have released products like the iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, and AirTag, significantly changing people's lifestyles and quality of life. One out of every four smartphones in South Korea is an iPhone, and over 10 million people use it. If we also count the unrecorded number of iPad users, the number is much higher. Despite the widespread use of Apple devices in South Korea, the ""Find My"" feature, which helps locate a lost device, has never been activated throughout most of South Korea since its introduction in 2010. South Korea is the only country in the world where this feature is intentionally blocked. Share your location with your family - Apple Support (English) Due to this limitation, when Apple devices are lost within South Korea, users cannot use the device's built-in location sharing feature. Even if the device is connected to the internet, they have to rely on memory or the sound the device makes. Moreover, if the device's internet connection is lost, they cannot determine the last known location. Many people, both Koreans and foreigners in South Korea, have lost Apple devices and were shocked to see ""No Location Found"" in Find My. Realizing it meant ""lost forever"" would undoubtedly turn their shock into despair. Apple devices also have a ""People"" feature allowing users to share their real-time location with each other. This is useful for families and friends to know each other's whereabouts and in emergencies. There have been instances in the US where kidnapped individuals were quickly located by the police using the Apple Watch's Find My service. However, this feature is entirely unusable in South Korea, leaving iPhone-using families helpless in emergencies. While iPhones have some form of location tracking based on mobile carrier towers, its accuracy pales in comparison to device-based GPS. According to data, the accuracy of carrier-based location tracking is between 100m to 200m at best, and much worse in less populated areas. In contrast, iPhone's GPS accuracy is less than 1m. AirTags, designed to show their location on a map, have been reduced to merely helping find items within a room in South Korea. iPhones can also act as detectors for AirTags, recognizing their location and relaying it to the owner. While many third-party products overseas have launched using AirTag's functionality, they are practically useless in South Korea due to these restrictions. Apple claims they cannot use the Find My location data due to local laws. However, there are inconsistencies in this claim. For instance, the Find My service works perfectly in territories like Baekryeongdo, Ulleungdo, and Dokdo, which are under South Korean jurisdiction. Apple's adherence to a supposed South Korean law that requires storing location data for six months is also questionable, given that other services like the Fitness app and photo geotagging seem to store and utilize location data without issues. As of December 1, 2022, many tech reviewers and influencers have covered Apple devices, but none have highlighted this inconsistency in the Find My service. Even information that the service works in some parts of South Korea was missing. It seems that most South Koreans have either taken this limitation for granted or are indifferent to it. Some might argue that people should simply not lose their belongings in the first place. However, humans are imperfect. No one intentionally loses things, and even if one is careful, others might mistakenly or intentionally take their belongings. Services like ""Find My"" exist to minimize the damage from such incidents. Apple should promptly address and resolve the limitations of the Find My service in South Korea.

It's a pity that there are only speculative articles in Korea and we can't check the exact facts. Link Mar 28, 2024 8:48 PM in response to Rhandhali My partner replaced a broken iPhone with a refurbished model of similar spec and was very frustrated to discover this quirk, we suspect the phone was originally sold as new in South Korea(?) Location sharing (was used often!) is now unavailable, i.e friends can’t see her location and she can’t see theirs, despite this working fine on her other iDevices. Surely this should be able to be restored if the phone is reset in another region that should support Apple location sharing?! Link Oct 17, 2023 4:53 AM in response to muguy I know that may be a reason of it but it is not officially said by Apple. Some people know that maybe the law related about map causes it but no one don't know what is the real problem is Link Oct 17, 2023 4:36 AM in response to FindMyKorea You’d have to ask the government. A quick search online shows that it may be related to a geographic collection requirement for companies to retain your data for 6 months. That likely violates Apple’s privacy policy. Link Oct 17, 2023 6:31 AM in response to senxtnn everything is speculation but if the law states that data must be retained if offering the service, and if Apple wishes to not violate a privacy right, those are at odds. Apple isn’t going to provide any detail Link Jan 21, 2024 1:59 AM in response to FindMyKorea Apple is currently not offering its 'Find My' service in Korea, citing local legal issues as the reason for being unable to locate or share device locations in the country. However, Apple has not specified which specific laws are causing this restriction. Some speculate the following: as Korean law mandates the retention of location information for six months, it is suggested that Apple's immediate deletion of location data within 2 hours or 24 hours contradicts Korea's data protection policies. However, this is not accurate. Korean law, like Apple's privacy policy, requires companies to promptly delete collected location information. The provision for a six-month retention period pertains to documenting the fact that the location data was collected. This document serves as a record that the information on collecting and providing location data is anonymized as much as possible, with no actual location data being recorded in the first place. In summary, Apple's privacy policy aligns with Korean law, and the claim that Apple is using Korean law as an excuse for not offering the 'Find My' feature in Korea is inaccurate. Link Jun 21, 2024 4:26 PM in response to muguy It turns out it has nothing to do with South Korean law. Earlier, Apple Korea responded to the Korea Communications Commission stating, ""'It is not because of the 'Act on the Protection and Use of Location Information' that we cannot activate the 'Find My' feature."" They added, ""It is related to the company's internal policies, and we cannot discuss specific details."" [Edited by Moderator] Link Oct 17, 2023 6:01 AM in response to FindMyKorea The law is the real problem as it requires Apple to collect personal data from users. If you think the service should be available, work to change the law or use a product which compiles and collects your data for who knows what reason. Link Oct 17, 2023 6:33 AM in response to muguy Another problem is that it is available in some areas of Korea, and if it was prohibited by law, I think find my should have been blocked in those areas, but I can still use it now, so if there are technical problems, I can't help it😢. Link Oct 17, 2023 1:15 AM in response to FindMyKorea I agree, Google maps is not working properly in Korea like Apple maps, but Google findmy is working in Korea unlike Apple findmy.

Apple,Objects of Our Life,https://stevejobsarchive.com/exhibits/objects-of-our-life,"Steve’s talk at the 1983 International Design Conference in Aspen Clips from Steve’s talk at the IDCA Steve rarely attended design conferences. This was 1983, before the launch of the Mac, and still relatively early days of Apple. I find it breathtaking how profound his understanding was of the dramatic changes that were about to happen as the computer became broadly accessible. Of course, beyond just being prophetic, he was fundamental in defining products that would change our culture and our lives forever. On the eve of launching the first truly personal computer, Steve is not solely preoccupied with the founding technology and functionality of the product’s design. This is extraordinarily unusual, as in the early stages of dramatic innovation, it is normally the primary technology that benefits from all of the attention and focus. Steve points out that the design effort in the U.S. at the time had been focused on the automobile, with little consideration or effort given to consumer electronics. While it is not unusual to hear leaders talk about the national responsibility to manufacture, I thought it was interesting that he talked about a nation’s responsibility to design. In the talk, Steve predicts that by 1986 sales of the PC would exceed sales of cars, and that in the following ten years, people would be spending more time with a PC than in a car. These were absurd claims for the early 1980s. Describing what he sees as the inevitability that this would be a pervasive new category, he asks the designers in the audience for help. He asks that they start to think about the design of these products, because designed well or designed poorly, they still would be made. Steve remains one of the best educators I’ve ever met in my life. He had that ability to explain incredibly abstract, complex technologies in terms that were accessible, tangible and relevant. You hear him describe the computer as doing nothing more than completing fairly mundane tasks, but doing so very quickly. He gives the example of running out to grab a bunch of flowers and returning by the time you could snap your fingers – speed rendering the task magical. When I look back on our work, what I remember most fondly are not the products but the process. Part of Steve’s brilliance was how he learned to support the creative process, encouraging and developing ideas even in large groups of people. He treated the process of creating with a rare and wonderful reverence. The revolution Steve described over 40 years ago did of course happen, partly because of his profound commitment to a kind of civic responsibility. He cared, way beyond any sort of functional imperative. His was a victory for beauty, for purity and, as he would say, for giving a damn. He truly believed that by making something useful, empowering and beautiful, we express our love for humanity. On a sunny June morning in 1983, Steve waits at the back of a giant tent, ready to take the stage at the International Design Conference in Aspen. This year’s theme is “The Future Isn’t What It Used to Be,” and he is here to talk about computers to an audience of several hundred designers and design-lovers. The night before, Steve gave a demonstration of the Lisa computer, one of the first commercially available machines with a mouse and a graphical user interface. These innovations meant that people would no longer need to type commands or punch arrow keys to use a computer. Instead they could use a mouse to click, drag, and navigate among icons, menus, and graphics—and even draw and paint. Interior of Aspen Amphitheater, 1983 Steve had been happy to introduce Apple’s latest product, but he knows that this morning’s speech, here under the gauzy Eero Saarinen–designed tent in the flower-filled fields of the Aspen Institute, is the main event. Called to the stage, he bounds down the center aisle, notebook in hand. He leaps up to take his place at the podium. He is the cofounder and chair of Apple, a “legend in his own time,” according to his onstage introduction—but he is also 28 and excited for this, his first formal talk to a gathering of esteemed designers. He has chosen not to title his presentation; the program refers to it only as “Talk.” He leans into the microphone. “They paid me sixty dollars, so I wore a tie,” he says, gesturing to the striped bow tie he has paired with a sports jacket and jeans. A grin stretches across his face; the audience laughs. He takes off his jacket, realizes there is nowhere to put it, and drops it to the floor, where it lays in a crumpled heap for the rest of his talk. “How many of you own an Apple?” he asks from the stage. No reaction. “Any, or…just any personal computer?” A bit of rustling from the audience. They are shifting in their seats. For most of them, design is still a craft of pencils, paper, rubber cement, straight edges, and clay. Steve laughs. “Uh–oh. How many of you’ve used one, or seen one—anything like that?” He must see a few hands raised in the audience. “Good. OK.” Steve rolls up his shirt sleeves. He has his work cut out for him. Apple Lisa Computer Print Advertisement, 1983 Computers were so rare in American homes at this time that the U.S. Census wouldn’t begin tracking their presence for another year. Even then, in 1984, only 8 percent of households had a computer (and of those that did, roughly 70 percent of those machines had been bought in the past two years). By contrast, 98 percent of households had televisions. People didn’t own computers, but they did have a sense that the machine was about to become very, very important. A few months before Steve spoke at Aspen, Time Magazine had bucked its own tradition to name the computer its Man of the Year, the machine thus joining the ranks of presidents, monarchs, astronauts, and peacemakers. And on the strength of the personal computer’s promise, Apple had just become the youngest company to join the Fortune 500. What this new machine would mean for daily life, however, was still unclear in 1983. An internal Apple document cautions that many people encountering a computer for the first time “might be a little bit afraid. They still aren’t sure they can actually operate a computer, but know it’s time they join the ‘revolution’.” Steve has come to Aspen as a standard-bearer for this revolution. Back at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, he is leading the development of everything he thinks the company will need to bring computers to “the rest of us”: the publicity, the advertising, the educational programs, the groundbreaking television commercial, and above all, the right machine. The Macintosh, of course, would be that machine, combining the best of the Lisa with other breakthroughs and packaging them all in a squat, friendly little case with a footprint hardly bigger than a typewriter. But he cannot talk about the work secretly in development, much less show it. His only tools are his passion and the blue spiral notebook he has placed on the lectern in front of him. On stage, Steve launches into a history of computing. He regularly consults his notebook, reading or glancing at its pages to confirm the year that the first computer-science degree was granted or details about the pioneering ENIAC computer and the timesharing models that followed. In the middle of this studied presentation, he interrupts himself. “Let me digress for a minute,” he says. Then he goes off script. “One of the reasons I’m here is because I need your help.” For this, the heart of his message to the designers in Aspen, he doesn’t need his notes. He predicts that the industry will sell three million computers in 1983 and ten million in 1986, “whether they look like a piece of shit or they look great.” The audience, pleasantly scandalized, laughs at his swearing, but Steve doesn’t crack a smile. He doesn’t say so, but he has already seen proof of what he considers indiscriminate taste: sales of the IBM PC, the computer Steve is likely thinking of when he says that current machines “look like garbage” and are a “pain in the ass,” have just overtaken sales of Apple’s flagship Apple II. One American industry after another—cars, televisions, cameras, watches—has lost market share to foreign competition, he explains, and he is worried that the same will happen with the computer if it becomes what he calls “one more piece-of-junk-object.” This moment, when “computers and society are out on a first date”—and here he interlaces his fingers to show how close that relationship could one day become—offers a rare opportunity that they must seize together. The audience is present at the birth of something monumental, and they can help define it. His voice rises with emotion. “We need help. We really, really need your help.” Steve has spent the past few years learning everything he can about design. He has always loved beautiful objects, and from its very beginning, Apple paid particular attention to product design. On the day the company was incorporated, Apple’s first board chair Mike Markkula circulated a memo reminding the staff, “People DO judge a book by its cover.” The Apple Marketing Philosophy, 1977 To serve as Apple’s first in-house designer, Steve hired Jerry Manock, who had worked a few miles up the road at Hewlett-Packard. Steve adored his HP-35 calculator, not just for its functionality but also for how it felt in his hand and for the haptic response of the keys when he pressed them. He wanted that attention to detail applied to Apple’s products. And as Apple hired more designers and worked with outside firms like Hovey-Kelley Design (whose co-founder David Kelley would go on to launch IDEO), Steve did everything he could to learn from the experts. He studied their fashion choices; a few days after he saw industrial designer Rob Gemmell in gray Nikes with cutting-edge Velcro straps, Steve showed up at work with a pair of his own. He sat in on meetings of the newly formed Apple design guild, where his being the only non-designer present did not stop him from offering merciless criticisms—a provocation some saw as presumptuous and others took as an invitation to push back or try to educate him. He wanted to talk about everything he saw, and he wanted to see everything. He looked closely at kitchen appliances and VW vans, wine labels, gallery paintings, motorcycles, and telephones. He took the Macintosh team to San Francisco’s de Young Museum to see an exhibit of Tiffany lamps. He asked Joanna Hoffman, a Macintosh marketing manager, about the Issey Miyake-designed clothes she had saved her money to buy: Did she think their asymmetry and superlative craftsmanship could ever have wide appeal in the United States? He was developing his eye, absorbing into his bones the lesson that good design is not mere decoration or ornament, but a paring away to help an object reveal its essence and, ultimately, evoke an emotional connection with its user. Along with several Apple designers, he toyed with the idea of filling a room with objects they loved, then directing new hires to spend their first day at work in that room. He curated his own life, choosing to live in an empty space with just a few exquisite things—a Tiffany lamp, a custom-assembled stereo system. Steve at home, sitting under his Tiffany lamp, photographed by Diana Walker in 1982 He later told an interviewer, “It comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done, and then try to bring those things into what you are doing.” He flew to Japan, where he met with Akio Morita, CEO of Sony, who gave him a first-generation Walkman, the portable music player Steve admired. He attended his first Aspen conference in 1981; the theme was “The Italian Idea,” and the work of designers such as Mario Bellini, Ettore Sottsass, Gae Aulenti, and Richard Sapper took center stage. He wrote to Mario Bellini and visited Italy to meet with Olivetti’s Ettore Sottsass. When Apple designers Gemmell and Manock proposed sponsoring a competition in which several top European designers would be invited to create a cohesive design language for a family of seven Apple products, Steve leapt at the idea. By the spring of 1982, he was vowing, “I want our design not just to be the best in the personal computer industry, but the best in the world.” No wonder he had prepared so carefully for the Aspen talk—he understood the opportunities and the stakes. Back on stage, Steve has returned to his blue notebook. He talks about the computer in the context of other media, the evolution from radio to television to videodisc. He explains how email works, describes drawing with a computer and a mouse, imagines a world in which computers are portable but have “radio links,” narrates in great detail an interactive map he saw from MIT, tries to explain why computer programs are “archetypal,” and points to the possibility that one day we might be able, in any given situation, to ask a computer, “What would Aristotle have said?”—and get an answer. MIT’s Aspen Movie Map, 1978–1980 The examples he offers demystify and catalyze in equal measure; they show what he is seeing, what others are imagining, and how it all fits together with breakthroughs that have come before. This is how Steve viewed innovation throughout his life: a constant accretion of what he called “sedimentary layers,” each one with the potential to raise humanity a bit higher, each generation building on the ideas of its predecessors. Steve ends his speech and without a pause starts taking questions. Apart from scripted product demonstrations, he always preferred the give-and-take of Q&As over prepared remarks, and this talk is no exception. His formal comments in the blue notebook ran about 20 minutes, but the Q&A will last nearly twice as long. He has developed a rapport with the audience, and their questions cover a wide range of issues: networking, privacy, graphic design, hiring and recruiting, and voice recognition. The biggest applause comes when Steve describes “Kids Can’t Wait,” Apple’s program to put a computer in every school in California. This audience of people who have never used computers now want their children to have access to them. In response to a question about computer-based tools for graphic design, he lays out a much larger core ambition, one that will become a life-long theme. “We’re solving the problems of injecting some liberal arts into these computers,” he says. Computers should include multiple fonts and graphics because they are beautiful in themselves but also because they serve as the gateway to so much more. An engaging, easy-to-understand interface will help draw people to the computer, making it possible for them to discover new ideas and convey their own in new ways and with new tools. “Where we’ve got to get to,” he says, is a place where no college student would think of writing a paper without a computer, where “people three, four years from now are using these things and they go, ‘Wasn’t this the way it always was?’” This sense of inevitability—so hard won, so hard to describe, and so obvious when achieved—is, for Steve, a hallmark of success. His sedimentary model of innovation works only if each generation takes the existing tools for granted. Perhaps the most revealing moment in the Q&A comes when Steve is asked about Apple’s low rate of employee turnover. He starts to answer by talking about the wide distribution of stock options, then swerves to describe what he thinks really underpins people’s commitment to their work. “We feel that for some crazy reason we’re in the right place at the right time to put something back,” he says, pausing to collect his thoughts. “Most of us didn’t make the clothes we’re wearing, and we didn’t cook or grow the food that we eat, and we’re speaking a language that was developed by other people; we use mathematics that was developed by other people.” He is emphasizing every word. “We are constantly taking–and the ability to put something back into that pool of human experiences is extremely neat.” This desire to “put something back” would drive his work throughout his life. The questions could go on, but Steve looks offstage and prompts, “I don’t know how much time we have?” As the crowd rises to their feet in a standing ovation, Steve picks up his coat off the floor, gives it a shake, and speeds up the aisle and out of the tent. A newspaper will later report, “An undercurrent was felt most of the day Wednesday and part of Thursday over whether Jobs was good or bad—visionary or huckster,” but Steve has no time for such debates. He has come to Aspen to speak but also to learn. Maya Lin, the 23-year-old student architect of the new stark and controversial Vietnam Veterans Memorial, is speaking nearby. He wants to hear her talk. Courtesy of GrassRoots Television Steve spoke at the Aspen Conference two other times in addition to his mainstage talk on the morning of June 15, 1983. The night before, dressed in a leather bomber jacket and a button-down shirt, Steve gave a demonstration of the Lisa computer in what he called a “multimedia show.” That “show” has been lost, as has most of Steve’s presentation, but we have a few minutes of it. Steve also spent 45 minutes in an informal Q&A session several hours after his mainstage talk. In New Balance sneakers, jeans, and a T-shirt from Ciao!, an Italian restaurant in San Francisco whose logo he loved, he sat backwards astride a metal folding chair and answered questions. Though the video shakes, the wind cuts through the audio, and questions are often muffled, Steve’s thoughts are worth sharing. Here are a few of our favorite clips. In this, our only clip from the footage of Steve’s Lisa demonstration on the evening of June 14, he draws parallels between the human brain and the computer.

Apple,"Cellebrite Unable to Unlock iPhones on iOS 17.4 or Later, Leak Reveals",https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/cellebrite-unable-to-unlock-iphones-on-ios-17-4/,"Israel-based mobile forensics company Cellebrite is unable to unlock iPhones running iOS 17.4 or later, according to leaked documents verified by 404 Media. The documents provide a rare glimpse into the capabilities of the company's mobile forensics tools and highlight the ongoing security improvements in Apple's latest devices. The leaked ""Cellebrite iOS Support Matrix"" obtained by 404 Media reveals that for all locked iPhones capable of running iOS 17.4 or newer, Cellebrite's status is listed as ""In Research,"" indicating they cannot reliably unlock these devices with their current tools. This limitation likely extends to a significant portion of modern iPhones, as Apple's own data from June shows that 77% of all iPhones and 87% of iPhones introduced in the last four years are running some version of iOS 17. Interestingly, the documents indicate that Cellebrite recently added support for the iPhone XR and iPhone 11 series running iOS 17.1 to 17.3.1. However, for iPhone 12 and newer models running these same iOS versions, the status is listed as ""Coming soon,"" suggesting Cellebrite's continuing attempts to keep pace with Apple's security advancements. Another document shows that Cellebrite can break into most Android devices, but not all of them. Cellebrite cannot, for example, brute force a turned-off Google Pixel 6, 7, or 8 to get the users' data. The revelation comes despite Cellebrite's marketing claims that their Premium service, which offers additional capabilities, can obtain passcodes for ""nearly all of today's mobile devices, including the latest iOS and Android versions."" Cellebrite's Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED) is widely used by law enforcement agencies worldwide for extracting data from mobile phones. Cellebrite first garnered significant attention in 2016, when it was believed the company was enlisted to help the FBI break into the ‌iPhone‌ 5c of San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook after Apple refused to provide the FBI with tools to unlock the device. The FBI did not use Cellebrite's services for that particular case, but several US government agencies do regularly work with Cellebrite to unlock iOS devices. Apple continually introduces improvements to the security of its operating systems in order to keep ahead of companies like Cellebrite that are always searching for flaws and vulnerabilities to exploit in order to access the data on locked iOS devices. For example, in October 2018 Apple successfully thwarted the ""GrayKey"" ‌iPhone‌ passcode hack, sold by Atlanta-based company Grayshift, which had also been in use by U.S. law enforcement.

Apple,iMessage patent row between Apple and MPH revived with new subpoena,https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/07/17/imessage-patent-row-between-apple-and-mph-revived-with-new-subpoena,"AAPL: 226.68 ( +2.37 ) Copyright © 2024 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. Messages on an iPhone Apple is fighting to make litigation funding firm Omni Bridgeway comply with a subpoena, demanding details about its relationship with MPH, a company Apple is in a patent lawsuit with over iMessage and FaceTime. Back in 2018, Finnish holdings firm MPH Technologies sued Apple over allegations the iPhone maker infringed its patents. In the latest event of the long-running lawsuit, Apple is trying to get information about MPH from a company allegedly funding the lawsuit. The patent lawsuit itself claimed that Apple infringed on IP for sending and forwarding messages over a secure connection. Apple's software affected by the suit includes iMessage, FaceTime, and an always-on VPN feature that's part of a mobile device management (MDM) solution. MPH had previously tried and failed to convince Apple to license its technology in 2016. The lawsuit died down for quite some time as Apple challenged the patents using the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, but it was revived in 2023. Reuters reports a new trial is scheduled for April 2025. More funding details, please In the case's revival, Apple had demanded details of any communications between MPH and third parties, including lawsuit funders, about the supposed patents and infringement. It was the belief that any doubts from third parties over the value of the patents would help Apple's case. MPH declined to provide the information, insisting that agreements with third-party funding sources would be irrelevant and that Apple's request was too broad. In June, a U.S. magistrate judge agreed with MPH, declining Apple's request. However, Apple was instructed to work with MPH on discovery disputes. However, in December, Apple quietly decided to go another route, subpoenaing Omni Bridgeway. The subpoena demanded documents and testimony about Omni Bridgeway's relationship with MPH. Reuters says there's no clear reason for Apple to believe Omni Bridgeway was involved in the case since those details are under seal. Omni Bridgeway did raise a number of objections to the subpoena, including how the demand was vague and sought information that was privileged. Sideways access By July, Apple tried to compel Omni Bridgeway to comply with the subpoena. However, rather than going through the San Francisco-based court and the existing MPH-Apple case, Apple did so in Delaware, where Omni Bridgeway is based. After the case was assigned to a Delaware judge, Omni Bridgeway moved to transfer the subpoena case to the same judge handling the Apple-MPH case. The Delaware officiant, U.S. District Judge Colm Connoly, requires litigants to disclose relationships to outside backers and if they have a say in legal strategy. Naturally, Apple has opposed the transfer from a potentially friendly judge, citing Omni's headquarters being located in the state. Omni, meanwhile, insists that the same San Francisco court should hear the main lawsuit. Judge Connolly has yet to rule on the matter.

Apple,Microsoft Designer brings AI image generation to iPhone before Apple Intelligence,https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/07/17/microsoft-designer-brings-ai-image-generation-to-iphone-before-apple-intelligence,"AAPL: 226.68 ( +2.37 ) Copyright © 2024 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. Microsoft Designer Last updated 4 days ago Microsoft Designer, a generative AI tool that produces images, has left preview and is now available as a free iOS app. Previously available in preview for close to a year, Microsoft Designer has finally become available to everyone. Trialled using Microsoft Edge and other browsers through a website, Designer is now open to use on more platforms, including apps for iOS, Android, and Windows. The app itself is free, but requires a Microsoft account to sign in and use. Previously, elements have been available through Copilot in Microsoft's other apps, including Word. Designer follows the typical usage patterns of generative AI systems that produce images. Users can make a text prompt, which is used to create the image, but there are also templates to make it easier to create social media images and greetings cards, for example. Along with creating new images, the app also has an avatar creation feature, and options to edit existing pictures. The latter includes tools to remove or change backgrounds and objects within the scene, or to entirely restyle the picture. Though free to download, users will be limited to 15 ""boosts"" each day, which are automatically consumed when AI-based changes are made to images. Users could upgrade to a $20 Copilot Pro subscription to get 100 boosts per day. Microsoft's launch of Designer arrives as the world waits for Apple to introduce Apple Intelligence in its betas, ahead of the fall release. Apple's system includes a generative AI image tool titled Image Playground to create images based on prompts. Like Microsoft's implementation, the Apple Intelligence version also has hooks into various Apple apps, so you can easily insert generated images. It can now be downloaded from Apple's App Store.

Apple,Apple says its OpenELM model doesn’t power Apple Intelligence amid YouTube controversy,https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/17/apple-intelligence-openelm-training-youtube/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=mastodon,"Earlier this week, an investigation detailed that Apple and other tech giants had used YouTube subtitles to train their AI models. This included over 170,000 videos from the likes of MKBHD, Mr. Beast, and more. Apple then used this dataset to train its open-source OpenELM models, which were released back in April. Apple has now confirmed to 9to5Mac, however, that OpenELM doesn’t power any of its AI or machine learning features – including Apple Intelligence. Apple says that it created the OpenELM model as a way of contributing to the research community and advancing open source large language model development. In the past, Apple researchers have described OpenELM as a “state-of-the-art open language model.” According to Apple, OpenELM was created only for research purposes, not for use to power any of its Apple Intelligence features. The model was published open-source and is widely available, including on Apple’s Machine Learning Research website. Because OpenELM isn’t used as part of Apple Intelligence, this means the “YouTube Subtitles” dataset isn’t used to power Apple Intelligence. In the past, Apple has said that Apple Intelligence models were trained “on licensed data, including data selected to enhance specific features, as well as publicly available data collected by our web-crawler.” Finally, Apple also tells me that it has no plans to build any new versions of the OpenELM model. As Wired reported earlier this week, companies including Apple, Anthropic, and NVIDIA all used this “YouTube Subtitles” dataset to train their AI models. This dataset is part of a larger collection called “The Pile,” from the non-profit EleutherAI. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Masters of the Air Based on Donald L. Miller’s book of the same name and scripted by John Orloff, Masters of the Air follows the men of the 100th Bomb Group (the “Bloody Hundredth”) as they conduct perilous bombing raids over Nazi Germany, and grapple with the frigid conditions, lack of oxygen, and sheer terror of combat conducted at 25,000 feet in the air. The psychological and emotional price paid by these young men as they helped destroy the horror of Hitler’s Third Reich is at the heart of Masters of the Air. Some were shot down and captured; some were wounded or killed. And some were lucky enough to make it home. Regardless of individual fate, a toll was exacted on them all.

Apple,Apple Scrambles to Fix AirPods Flaw That Put Users at a Security Risk,https://www.headphonesty.com/2024/07/apple-fixes-airpods-flaw-users-risk/,"We independently review all our recommendations. Purchases made via our links may earn us a commission. Learn more ❯ Update your AirPods ASAP if you don’t want to be eavesdropped on. Apple recently faced another security challenge, prompting it to release an urgent firmware update for AirPods and other wireless headphones. This update addresses a severe vulnerability that allowed hackers to spoof devices and eavesdrop on users, which was a big threat to user privacy. The flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-27867, was discovered by security researcher Jonas Dreßler and was admitted by Apple last June 25, 2024. It affects AirPods (2nd generation and later), AirPods Pro (all models), AirPods Max, Powerbeats Pro, and Beats Fit Pro. In other words, while reconnecting to previously paired devices, hackers could intercept the Bluetooth signal and mimic a trusted device. This tricks the headphones into pairing with the attacker’s device instead. Once paired, the attacker could gain full control over the headphones. So, they can eavesdrop on any audio played through the headphones, including private conversations. This could lead to stealing sensitive info, whether personal, work-related, or financial. To address the issue, Apple released the following firmware updates to improve the AirPods’ state management: These updates make the process of authentication of devices during pairing and reconnecting better. The improved state management involves more careful checks when Bluetooth pairing happens to make sure the device trying to connect is really one that was approved before. This includes handling the info about previously paired devices better so it’s harder for attackers to copy the digital signature of these devices. This update follows a series of recent security concerns for Apple. In June 2024, the company released updates for visionOS to address 21 security issues, including seven WebKit flaws. Among these, a logic flaw could have resulted in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack when processing web content. Apple has faced other security challenges this year. Vulnerabilities in iPhone and iPad operating systems allowed apps to access sensitive user information. Additionally, security flaws in Apple Watches could have exposed private data. Today, Apple’s own apps continue to collect data, making it difficult for users to stop data sharing. Siri, for instance, automatically gathers data from the apps users use. This includes everything from music listening history to contact names. Despite these incidents, privacy remains central to Apple’s brand. The company even declined an AI partnership with Meta due to concerns over its privacy practices. Bluetooth headphones are vulnerable to hacking due to the wireless nature of their connections. Hackers can exploit these weaknesses to access devices and steal data. Here are some common ways this happens: Here’s what you can do to keep yourself safe from Bluetooth hacking: Comment * Name * Email *",2024-07-18
Apple,iPhone 15 adoption continues to weaken compared to iPhone 14,https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/17/iphone-15-adoption-continues-to-weaken-compared-to-iphone-14/,"Earlier this year we saw a report from CIRP with data showing the adoption of the iPhone 15 lineup in the US coming in below what Apple saw with the iPhone 14 devices. Now CIRP’s Q2 data has landed on the same metric and the iPhone 15 lineup demand has weakened again. For Q1 2024, iPhone 15 devices made up 68% of total US iPhone sales. That was down 7% from the 75% share the iPhone 14 devices had in Q1 2023. Now for Q2, the difference between iPhone 15 and 14 adoption has increased. Between April and June 2024, the iPhone 15 lineup made up 67% of total US iPhone sales. That’s a 1% decline from Q1. In comparison, for Q2 2023, the iPhone 14 lineup made up 79% of US iPhone sales – which was a 4% increase from Q1 2023. That marks a 12% lower adoption of iPhone 15 than iPhone 14 in their respective launch years. Because there was basically no reason to upgrade other than USB-C. Got my wife a 14 Pro instead because ATT was offering ridiculous deals at the time. $5/month for a 256gb 14 Pro vs $30/month for a 15 Pro. Simple math. Whatever Apple has planned for the 16 I sure as heck hope it’s more innovation than iteration, because AI isn’t the great savior they hope it is. As shown in the chart below, the only 2024 iPhone model to match 2023 adoption was the 15 Pro Max at 22% like the 14 Pro Max a year earlier. However, the iPhone 15, Plus, and Pro all saw lower adoption compared to their iPhone 14 counterparts. CIRP highlights that the loss in iPhone 15 sales was mostly absorbed by the year-old iPhone 14/Plus models. This latest report comes as another data point signaling a decline in consumers spending top-dollar on the latest and greatest iPhones as hardware updates become more iterative.

Apple,How to customize and use the all-new Control Center in iOS 18,https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/17/customize-use-control-center-in-ios-18/,"iOS 18 brings a major update to Control Center that expands both capabilities and customization. The quick access controls go from a single page to multiple ones that you can smoothly slide through, third-party integration, and more. Here’s how to customize and use Control Center in iOS 18. Control Center first launched in 2013 with iOS 7. While there have been tweaks over the last decade, it’s remained largely the same. iOS 18 marks a major overhaul to the easy-access controls with a Favorites page as the first screen followed by Music, Home, and Connectivity pages. All of the new Control Center screens are customizable and you can add additional Control Center pages. Providing even more functionality, Apple is opening Control Center to third-party apps and you can invoke it from the iPhone Lock Screen as well as the Home Screen. Here’s how it looks to customize and use Control Center in iOS 18: There are lots of native iOS controls you can add and you can also use the search bar at the top. Over time we’ll see third-party app controls launch too – but don’t expect those for a bit. After you add new buttons and controls, you can try long pressing and dragging on the corner of one to expand or contract the size. Here’s how the Music, Home, and Connectivity pages look – you can customize and change all of these defaults. To add another page, enter edit mode then tap the dotted-line circle icon as shown in the far-right screenshot above. There’s even a new power button in Control Center in the top right corner giving quick access to shutting down your device. Apple showed off a third-party Control Center button from Ford at WWDC. We’ll have to wait to see them arrive widely as we get closer to the public launch of iOS 18. What do you think about the new Control Center in iOS 18? Share your thoughts in the comments!

Apple,Here’s the new Passwords app in iOS 18,https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/17/hands-on-heres-the-new-passwords-app-in-ios-18/,"iOS 18 is a huge release for iPhone users. It brings major updates to system apps like Photos, Messages, Notes, and more. The release also introduces two brand new apps from Apple: Image Playground for creating AI images (not yet available in the iOS 18 beta), and the new Passwords app that makes password management on Apple devices easier than ever. Here’s a look at everything the new Passwords app can do. In previous versions of iOS, Apple supplied a password management tool as part of the Settings app. Using iCloud Keychain, you could have passwords automatically generated for you and saved inside Settings under the Passwords screen. In iOS 18, passwords are breaking out of the Settings app and into their own, dedicated app. If you’ve already been using the existing Passwords features of iOS 17 and earlier, there’s not a whole lot to get excited about with the new Passwords app. It offers much of the same functionality, but with a bit more organization and accessibility than before. Open Passwords and you’ll see a design similar to the Reminders app, with a variety of categories immediately visible: You’ll also see a section for Family Passwords if that’s a feature you’ve taken advantage of through Family Sharing previously. Finally, at the bottom-left of the screen you’ll find the option to create a new shared group of passwords. Create the group name, then invite other users to join the group with you. One essential component of a successful Passwords app is that it needs to exist across all your devices. Apple has taken that to heart and built the new Passwords app not just on iPhone with iOS 18, but it’s also available in iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and visionOS 2. You can even access your stored passwords on Windows via the iCloud for Windows app. I don't agree the main customers are new users. I have go in to the Passwords app via Settings every day, and it's annoying. I can't wait to get in more directly. Even though there may not be a whole lot new about the Passwords app for users who already benefited from the previous iCloud Keychain features, the main target audience for Passwords is likely people who don’t even know what a password manager is. The average user probably has never heard of 1Password or LastPass, and they may or may not be aware that the iPhone can automatically create and store passwords for them. For users like that, a new Passwords app showing up on their iPhone’s Home screen this fall is going to hopefully lead them to a more secure computing future. The new Passwords app is, in a way, an acknowledgement that Passkeys are going to take a long while to fully replace passwords. And in the meantime, we could all benefit from tools that make password management more seamless and accessible. The Passwords app should do just that when it arrives on users’ devices this fall.

Apple,Apple Product Managers Discuss Cool New iPadOS 18 Features,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/17/apple-product-managers-discuss-ipados-18/,"With iPadOS 18, Apple added some useful iPad-specific features in the Notes app, including Smart Script and Math Notes. Both of these additions are designed to work with the Apple Pencil, and they're some of the neater new features on Apple's tablets. Apple product manager Ty Jordan and engineering manager Jenny Chen recently did an interview with Chris Lawley to discuss the work that went into the ‌iPadOS 18‌ updates. Smart Script is one of the ways that Apple is using machine learning in ‌iPadOS 18‌. It refines handwritten text, making your handwriting look neater without losing the personal flare that makes it your handwriting rather than generic writing. Smart Script learns your handwriting style, which Jordan said makes it as useful as typed text. You'll notice that as soon as you start writing words, it refines your handwriting. You'll notice that it spell checks, so if you make a spelling mistake, it'll be underlined. It can also do some really cool things with reflowing your text, so if you tap and hold your Pencil, you can move words around, and you'll see that it reflows in your paragraph so you can get some more space. You can even paste typed text as your own handwritten text right in the middle of a paragraph, so a lot of things that we take for granted with typed text, you can now do with handwritten text. Smart Script learns continually and while it is designed to work quickly, it will get better over time as you write more, especially for features such as paste as handwriting. Recognition does not persist from note to note, however. Apple wanted the feature to feel personal and not like a font, which is why it refines dynamically with each note. It's very contextual. So, for example, if you were to go to a previous paragraph where you had some band handwriting, we're going to match the handwriting that was refined there and not sort of try to replicate what you've had in other notes. As for Math Notes, Jordan said that Apple took the time to ""really reimagine"" the calculator feature could be designed for the iPad's interface. If you're unfamiliar with the feature, Math Notes on ‌iPad‌ lets you write out equations with the ‌Apple Pencil‌, with the Notes app solving the equation automatically when an equals sign is added. It sort of works like magic. It combines the natural input of a pencil with the amazing on-device machine learning models that Jenny and her teams work on. You just write math like on a piece of paper and like magic, it just gives you the answer. It's so simple and intuitive. Math Notes is able to recognize variables and the numbers associated with them. So if you define variables like price and area in one part of the note, and then write ""price x area,"" Math Notes is able to provide an answer using the numbers specified earlier. Jordan explains: I'll do my best shot and go back to high school. So a variable is just a named value, right? So you probably know a lot of them from school, like X and Y, and you could declare a variable with that [...] but you can do this with any word that you want. I've personally loved using it for natural experiences, where I might declare like drinks equal something and food equals something else, and then I can just say that plus that and divided by the number of people, and I get an answer. So it just creates this very natural way to work with your math. Math Notes is intelligent enough to understand the difference between separate variables in a note, so if you have multiple math problems with the same variable like X, it won't get confused. You can have graphs added automatically in Math Notes if an equation can be grafted, which Chen says uses the work that Apple has previously done for the Swift Charts API. If you're interested in more context on the new Notes features in ‌iPadOS 18‌, the full video is well worth watching. Both Math Notes and Smart Script are available in the ‌iPadOS 18‌ beta, which developers and public beta testers can download. The new features will launch in the fall.

Apple,iDOS 3 waiting for review (rejected),https://litchie.com/2024/04/new-hope,"Earlier quite a few iDOS users and supporters reached out to me to let me know about the recent AppStore policy change (Thanks, EU). In light of this, I decided to resubmit iDOS. However, it looks like Apple has blacklisted iDOS 2, preventing me from even requesting a review under that title, and I had to submit under a brand new title ""iDOS 3"". Here's where things got interesting. Initially they rejected the submission because it was same as iDOS 2, but after I explained to them that I can not continue under iDOS2, then they rejected again as ""Design spam"" on the basis that there has been many submissions lately with the exact same design. I don't actually care much about the copycats, but just can't understand why it's difficult for Apple to check my account history and tell which is the original. It's a little bit insulting that I had to tell the story to them time and time again and yet the issue is unresolved after 1 week. For the people that are waiting, I am hopeful that we will sort it out eventually. And if everything indeed goes well, there will be updates coming to justify this version bump. Update 2024-05-08: ""Your app is in review but is requiring additional time."" Makes me wonder if the reviewer is trying to play a game through. Update 2024-06-15: Got a call from Apple after 2 months. They have decided that iDOS is not a retro game console, so the new rule is not applicable. They suggested I make changes and resubmit for review, but when I asked what changes I should make to be compliant, they had no idea, nor when I asked what a retro game console is. It's still the same old unreasonable answer along the line of ""we know it when we see it"". Update 2024-07-14: Got an email from a user about the recent approval of UTM. Given iDOS was rejected based on the same reason previously, I resubmitted for review and was rejected really quick: ""The app still provides emulator functionality but is not emulating a retro game console specifically. Only emulators of retro game consoles are appropriate per guideline 4.7."". Really hard to guess what is going on in their mind. Update 2024-07-16: Appeal was rejected by App Review Board: ""We understand that you might disagree with our findings. However, the app still provides emulator functionality but is not emulating a retro game console specifically. Only emulators of retro game consoles are appropriate per guideline 4.7."" As to why UTM was approved but not iDOS, they wrote: ""If you believe that you have identified apps that don't comply with the App Review Guidelines, you may use the Report an app form at any time to report trust and safety concerns for apps on the App Store."" Thanks, but no, that is ridiculous, I have zero concern about trust and safety running an emulator. Update 2024-06-15: Got a call from Apple after 2 months.

Apple,This case turns your Apple Watch into a tiny iPod,https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200520/tinypod-apple-watch-accessory-ipod-case-scroll-wheel,"By Allison Johnson, a reviewer with 10 years of experience writing about consumer tech. She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview. If you’ve been feeling nostalgic for your old iPod lately, well, I have great news. TinyPod is a case you put on your Apple Watch — sans strap — so you can hold it and use it like your favorite vintage MP3 player. A $79 version includes a scroll wheel, which physically turns the watch’s digital crown. For $29, you can get a case without the scroll wheel and with a cutout so you can access the digital crown directly. But TinyPod could be more than just a way to turn your watch into a cute media player — it’s designed to make your watch a more capable companion to your phone. Recently, we’ve seen all kinds of gadgets and minimalist phones that promise to help you disconnect while still keeping you connected to the essentials. But largely, they’re too underpowered, fiddly, or just not smart enough to be useful, and the smartphone as we know it remains undefeated. That’s why the TinyPod’s “if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em” stance is so appealing. It’s not a replacement for your phone, it’s designed to be “your phone away from phone,” as the company calls it. And although you can put any old Apple Watch in the case, the concept makes the most sense with a cellular model. Leave your phone behind while you maintain access to the essentials like messaging, calls, mobile payments, and music playback — the minimalist phone dream. If this all rings a bell, you might be thinking of the concept for an iPod Nano-inspired watch case designed by Joyce Kang that surfaced a few years ago. Despite claims that it was “coming soon,” it doesn’t appear that the case ever made it to market. Kang’s case was more of an exercise in nostalgia, too, since the scroll wheel was nonfunctional. TinyPod appears to be much closer to reality — it’s shipping “this summer,” according to the company’s website, and you can order one now in three different sizes. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Apple,Kuo: Apple Delays Change Aimed at Saving Space Inside Future iPhones,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/17/kuo-iphone-17-wont-use-resin-coated-copper/,"Apple no longer plans to use resin-coated copper for logic boards in iPhone 17 models next year, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said today. Kuo said resin-coated copper failed to meet Apple's ""high-quality requirements,"" leading to the company scrapping its plans to adopt the material for iPhone 17 models. It is unclear if Apple will revisit resin-coated copper for iPhone 18 models or later, but it appears that the material is at least a few years away from being used in iPhones. Resin-coated copper is a thin layer of copper foil coated with a resin, such as an epoxy. The material would allow for a thinner logic board, which in turn would provide more internal space for other components and sensors in future iPhones. It was also rumored that at least one new Apple Watch would use resin-coated copper this year, but it is unclear if that plan has been delayed too. Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

Apple,Apple Pay under investigation in U.K. amid ‘seismic shift’ in consumer behavior,https://www.macworld.com/article/2399864/apple-pay-investigation-uk-consumer-behavior.html,"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Two U.K. regulatory bodies have announced a joint investigation into the benefits and risks of digital wallets, including Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal. In a press release Monday, the Payments Systems Regulator (PSR) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) launched what they describe as a “call for information” as they seek to understand changes to the consumer landscape. Noting that the proportion using digital wallets has risen steeply–now likely above half of U.K. adults, they said–the authorities detailed areas of interest and concern, including the benefits such wallets bring to users, features that don’t work as well as they might, and their effect on competition and the integrity of the free market. “Digital wallets are steadily becoming a go-to payment type, and while this presents exciting opportunities, there might be risks too,” wrote PSR managing director David Geale. “Collaboration between regulators and working with industry is crucial to ensure we’re on the front foot to support innovation and competition.” Although Apple is only one of the firms explicitly mentioned in the press release, which also includes Google Pay and PayPal, the timing of this announcement suggests regulators may be particularly interested in monitoring the influence on free competition exerted by Apple Pay. As Bloomberg notes, it comes only days after Apple successfully avoided being fined by the European Union by opening up its tap-to-pay tech to other payment service providers. The U.K. is no longer a member of the European Union but follows its lead in many regulatory matters. And any mandates overseas are likely to affect Apple’s operations in the U.S. as well. The regulators said they are “interested in hearing from stakeholders across the payments and wider financial services landscape, including digital wallet and technology providers as well as their service users and other parties with an interest in digital wallets.” Respondents have until September 13, after which the authorities pledge to consider all feedback and issue an update by the first quarter of 2025. David has been writing about technology for well over two decades, and got on board the Apple hype train when covering the original iPhone launch in 2007. He is an enthusiastic Apple Watch evangelist and feels that the HomePod is misunderstood.

Apple,"The watchOS 11 beta slowed me down, in a good way | Fitness tracking on the Apple Watch is finally moving away from the blanket approach of ‘always do more.’",https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/15/24195983/watchos-11-preview-training-load-vitals-fitness,"By Victoria Song, a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 12 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. One thing always irked me about the Apple Watch. Rain or shine, in sickness and in health, it pushed me to close my rings. Never mind if I had covid-19, shin splints, or was mentally in a dark place. It nudged me to be a “better” version of myself, so long as better didn’t involve a day off. But with watchOS 11 — the public beta of which arrives today — it feels like my Apple Watch is finally cutting me some slack. This is largely due to a trio of new features: the new Vitals app, Training Load feature, and the ability to pause your Activity Rings. I waxed lyrical about the latter right after WWDC, but after spending some time with the developer beta, I’m convinced these are the smartest fitness updates Apple’s rolled out in years. The Vitals app and Training Load feature are technically two separate things, but in practice, they very much go hand in hand. The Vitals app contextualizes a set of metrics: heart rate, respiratory rate, wrist temperature, blood oxygen, and sleep duration. These are all recovery metrics, most commonly packaged in other apps as a readiness score, except Apple’s version doesn’t give you a single score. Rather, it shows you whether your metrics are “typical” or an “outlier.” If two or more metrics are out of range, you’ll get a notification and some possibilities as to why certain metrics are out of whack. The Training Load feature is also straightforward. It compares and visualizes your seven-day versus 28-day exercise load. Based on that, you can see whether you’re well below, below, steady, above, or well above your usual activity levels. It breaks this down not only by overall activity but also by individual activity types (i.e., running, pilates, cycling, etc.). After a workout, you can also rate your perceived effort level. For popular workouts, like running, it’ll automatically set your effort level. (You can manually edit it if you disagree, which I occasionally did, though it’s broadly accurate.) It’s been nice to have both of these features over the past month, though, like most of the updates in watchOS 11, they’re a bit passive. For example, I’ve not had a single Vitals notification because, well, all my vital metrics have stayed within their typical range. Yay me for being consistent! This isn’t a bad thing — you don’t want to get frequent notifications. It’s more that having the quick visual of “is everything hunky dory?” is helpful when you’re on the fence about whether to push it or take a rest day. That’s the benefit of Training Load, too, especially for folks newer to exercise or training. I’m experienced enough to know that my current Training Load is a little skewed because I took a whole week off of training while on vacation. (Right around the time when I downloaded the beta.) Yet it is a helpful visual reminder for me when I am well above my 28-day baseline that I can take a break for a day. A rest day isn’t going to set me back. Apple isn’t doing anything here that we haven’t seen from Garmin, Polar, Oura, Fitbit, Whoop, or any other health and fitness tracker in the past five years. Rather, Apple’s version makes these concepts easily digestible for beginners. It’s also less data overload for burnt-out athletes. Combined with the ability to pause rings or customize your goals based on the day of the week, you’ve got a much more flexible fitness tracking experience on the world’s most popular smartwatch. That’s a huge deal. Ultimately, these features make the Apple Watch’s fitness tracking platform more personalized, which seems to be the overarching theme of watchOS 11. Instead of a blanket approach of always doing more, you can make alternative choices based on your actual day-to-day circumstances. I’m still testing a bunch of other watchOS 11 features, but as far as the marquee fitness tracking updates go, I’ve been pleasantly surprised at how it’s encouraged me to be kinder to myself. My main gripe is that Apple still doesn’t tell you to outright take a rest day. You have to infer from phrases like “recover as needed if you start feeling run down” or “you’ve been in the above or well above range for 14 days.” I also lost a couple nights’ worth of Vitals data because I had to charge my watch overnight — a reminder that battery life and charging schedules remain the Achilles’ heel of smartwatches. But overall, that’s still much more sustainable long term for most people than the previous blanket approach of “always do more.” Maybe in watchOS 12, my Apple Watch will finally bully me into putting my feet up on the couch. But for now, baby steps are still steps in the right direction. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Apple,Private Browsing 2.0,https://webkit.org/blog/15697/private-browsing-2-0/,"Jul 16, 2024 by John Wilander, Charlie Wolfe, Matthew Finkel, Wenson Hsieh, and Keith Holleman When we invented Private Browsing back in 2005, our aim was to provide users with an easy way to keep their browsing private from anyone who shared the same device. We created a mode where users do not leave any local, persistent traces of their browsing. Eventually all other browsers shipped the same feature. At times, this is called “ephemeral browsing.” We baked in cross-site tracking prevention in all Safari browsing through our cookie policy, starting with Safari 1.0 in 2003. And we’ve increased privacy protections incrementally over the last 20 years. (Learn more by reading Tracking Prevention in Webkit.) Other popular browsers have not been as quick to follow our lead in tracking prevention but there is progress. Apple believes that users should not be tracked across the web without their knowledge or their consent. Entering Private Browsing is a strong signal that the user wants the best possible protection against privacy invasions, while still being able to enjoy and utilize the web. Staying with the 2005 definition of private mode as only being ephemeral, such as Chrome’s Incognito Mode, simply doesn’t cut it anymore. Users expect and deserve more. So, we decided to take Private Browsing further and add even more protection beyond the normal Safari experience. Last September, we added a whole new level of privacy protections to Private Browsing in Safari 17.0. And we enhanced it even further in Safari 17.2 and Safari 17.5. Plus, when a user enables them, all of the new safeguards are available in regular Safari browsing too. With this work we’ve enhanced web privacy immensely and hope to set a new industry standard for what Private Browsing should be. These are the protections and defenses added to Private Browsing in Safari 17.0: In addition, we added these protections and defenses in all browsing modes: We also expanded Web AdAttributionKit (formerly Private Click Measurement) as a replacement for tracking parameters in URL to help developers understand the performance of their marketing campaigns even under Private Browsing. However, before we dive into these new and enhanced privacy protections, let’s first consider an important aspect of these changes: website compatibility risk. There are many ideas for how to protect privacy on the web, but unfortunately many of them may break the user’s experience. Like security protections in real life, a balance must be struck. The new Private Browsing goes right up to the line, attempting to never break websites. But of course there is a risk that some parts of some sites won’t work. To solve this, we give users affordances to reduce privacy protections on a per-site basis. Such a change in privacy protections is only remembered while browsing within a site. This option is a last resort when a web page is not usable due to the privacy protections. All of the new privacy protections in Private Browsing are also available in regular browsing. On iOS, iPadOS and visionOS go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Advanced > Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection and enable “All Browsing”. On macOS go to Safari > Settings > Advanced and enable “Use advanced tracking and fingerprinting protection”: Let’s now walk through how these enhancements work. Safari’s Private Browsing implements two new protections against tracking information in the destination URL when the user navigates between different websites. The specific parts of the URL covered are query parameters and the fragment. The goal of these protections is to make it more difficult for third-party scripts running on the destination site to correlate user activity across websites by reading the URL. Let’s consider an example where the user clicks a link on clickSource.example, which takes them to clickDestination.example. The URL looks like this: Safari removes a subset of query parameters that have been identified as being used for pervasive cross-site tracking granular to users or clicks. This is done prior to navigation, such that these values are never propagated over the network. If known_tracking_param above represents such a query parameter, the URL that’s used for navigation will be: As its name suggests, the campaign above represents a parameter that’s only used for campaign attribution, as opposed to click or user-level tracking. Safari allows such parameters to pass through. Finally, on the destination site after a cross-site navigation, all third-party scripts that attempt to read the full URL (e.g. using location.search, location.href, or document.URL) will get a version of the URL that has no query parameters or fragment. In our example, this script-exposed value is simply: In a similar vein, Safari also hides cross-site any document.referrer from script access in Private Browsing. Web AdAttributionKit (formerly Private Click Measurement) is a way for advertisers, websites, and apps to implement ad attribution and click measurement in a privacy-preserving way. You can read more about it here. Alongside the new suite of enhanced privacy protections in Private Browsing, Safari also brings a version of Web AdAttributionKit to Private Browsing. This allows click measurement and attribution to continue working in a privacy-preserving manner. Web AdAttributionKit in Private Browsing works the same way as it does in normal browsing, but with some limits: Safari 17.0 also comes with an automatically enabled content blocker in Private Browsing, which blocks network loads to known trackers. While Intelligent Tracking Prevention has long blocked all third party cookies, blocking trackers’ network requests from leaving the user’s device in the first place ensures that no personal information or tracking parameters are exfiltrated through the URL itself. This automatically enabled content blocker is compiled using data from DuckDuckGo and from the EasyPrivacy filtering rules from EasyList. The requests flagged by this content blocker are only entries that are flagged as trackers by both DuckDuckGo and EasyPrivacy. In doing so, Safari intentionally allows most ads to continue loading even in Private Browsing. Private Browsing also blocks cloaked network requests to known tracking domains. They otherwise have the ability to save third party cookies in a first-party context. This protection requires macOS Sonoma or iOS 17. By cloaked we mean subdomains mapped to a third-party server via CNAME cloaking or third-party IP address cloaking. See also the “Defending Against Cloaked First Party IP Addresses” section below. When Safari blocks a network request to a known tracker, a console message of this form is logged, and can be viewed using Web Inspector: Safari 15.0 started hiding IP addresses from known trackers by default. Private Browsing in Safari 17.0 adds the following protections for all users: Additionally, for iCloud+ subscribers who have iCloud Private Relay turned on, Private Browsing takes privacy to the next level with these enhancements: Safari 17.0 also boosts the privacy of Extensions in Private Browsing. Extensions that can access website data and browsing history are now off by default in Private Browsing. Users can still choose to allow an extension to run in Private Browsing and gain all of the extension’s utility. Extensions that don’t access webpage contents or browsing history, like Content Blockers, are turned on by default in Private Browsing when turned on in Safari. With Safari and subsequently other browsers restricting stateful tracking (e.g. cross-site cookies), many trackers have turned to stateless tracking, often referred to as fingerprinting. We distinguish these types of fingerprinting: A challenge for any tracker trying to create a fingerprint is how stable the fingerprint will be over time. Software version fingerprinting changes with software updates, web extension fingerprinting changes with extension updates and enablement/disablement, user settings change when the user wants, multiple users of the same device means behavior fingerprints change, and roaming devices may change network and geographic position a lot. Fingerprints can be used to track the user across websites. If successful, it defeats tracking preventions such as storage partitioning and link decoration filtering. There are two types of solutions to this problem: Less talked about is the fingerprinting problem of per-site user recall. Web browsers offer at least two ways for the user to reset their relationship with a website: Clear website data or use Private Browsing. Both make a subsequent navigation to a website start out fresh. But fingerprinting defeats this and allows a website to remember the user even though they’ve opted to clear website data or use Private Browsing. There are two types of solutions to this problem: The ultimate anti fingerprinting challenge in our view is to address a specific user’s uniqueness when visiting a specific website. Here’s a simple example: Having the locale setting to US/EN for American English may provide ample herd immunity in many cases. But what happens when a user with that setting visits an Icelandic government website or a Korean reading club website? They may find themselves in a very small “herd” on that particular website and combined with just a few more fingerprinting touch points they can be uniquely identified. Addressing per-site visitor uniqueness is not possible in general by a browser unless it knows what the spread of visitors looks like for individual websites. We view cross-site tracking and per-site user recall as privacy problems to be addressed by browsers. Our approach: Make the fingerprint unique per website, and generate a new unique fingerprint for every fresh start such as at website data removal. Our tools: Safari’s new advanced fingerprinting protections make it difficult for scripts to reliably extract high-entropy data through the use of several web APIs: Many modern web browsers use a computer’s graphics processing unit (GPU) to accelerate rendering graphics. The Web’s Canvas API (2D Canvas) and WebGL API give a web page the tools it needs for rendering arbitrary images and complex scenes using the GPU, and analyzing the result. These APIs are valuable for the web platform, but they allow the web page to learn unique details about the underlying hardware without asking for consent. With Safari’s advanced fingerprinting protections enabled, Safari applies tiny amounts of noise to pixels on the canvas that have been painted using drawing commands. These modifications reduce the value of a fingerprint when using these APIs without significantly impacting the rendered graphics. It’s important to emphasize that: This strategy helps mitigate many of the compatibility issues that arise from this kind of noise injection, while still maintaining robust fingerprinting mitigations. In Safari 17.5, we’ve bolstered these protections by additionally injecting noise when reading back data from offscreen canvas in both service workers and shared workers. Similarly, when reading samples using the WebAudio API — via AudioBuffer.getChannelData() — a tiny amount of noise is applied to each sample to make it very difficult to reliably measure OS differences. In practice, these differences are already extremely minor. Typically due to slight differences in the order of operations when applying FFT or IFFT. As such, a relatively low amount of noise can make it substantially more difficult to obtain a stable fingerprint. In Safari 17.5, we made audio noise injection more robust in the following ways: This noise injection also activates when using Audio Worklets (e.g. AudioWorkletNode) to read back audio samples. Lastly, for various web APIs that currently directly expose window and screen-related metrics, Safari takes a different approach: instead of the noise-injection-based mitigations described above, entropy is reduced by fixing the results to either hard-coded values, or values that match other APIs. These mitigations also apply when using media queries to indirectly observe the screen size. We have worked for many years with the standards community on improving user privacy of the web platform. There are existing web APIs that are fingerprintable, such as Canvas, and reining in their fingerprintability is a long journey. Especially since we want to ensure existing websites can continue to work well. It is key for the future privacy of the web to not compound the fingerprinting problem with new, fingerprintable APIs. There are cases where the tradeoff tells us that a rich web experience or enhanced accessibility motivates some level of fingerprintability. But in general, our position is that we should progress the web without increasing fingerprintability. A recent example where we opposed a new proposal is the Topics API which is now shipping in the Chrome browser. We provided extensive critical feedback as part of the standards process and we’d like to highlight a few pieces here. From the proposal: Any JavaScript can call this function on a webpage. Yes, that includes tracker scripts, advertising scripts, and data broker scripts. The topics come from a predefined list of hundreds of topics. It’s not the user who picks from these topics, but instead Chrome will record the user’s browsing history over time and deduce interests from it. The user doesn’t get told upfront which topics Chrome has tagged them with or which topics it exposes to which parties. It all happens in the background and by default. The intent of the API is to help advertisers target users with ads based on each user’s interests even though the current website does not necessarily imply that they have those interests. A new research paper by Yohan Beugin and Patrick McDaniel from University of Wisconsin-Madison goes into detail on Chrome’s actual implementation of the Topics API. The authors use large scale real user browsing data (voluntarily donated) to show both how the 5% noise supposed to provide plausible deniability for users can be defeated, and how the Topics API can be used to fingerprint and re-identify users. “We conclude that an important part of the users from this real dataset are re-identified across websites through only the observations of their topics of interest in our experiment. Thus, the real users from our dataset can be fingerprinted through the Topics API. Moreover, as can be seen, the information leakage and so, privacy violation worsen over time as more users are uniquely re-identified.” —Beugin and McDaniel, University of Wisconsin-Madison The paper was published at the 2024 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW) in May. Re-identifying and tracking users is not the only privacy problem with the Topics API. There is also the profiling of users’ cross-site activity. Here’s an example using topics on Chrome’s predefined list. Imagine in May 2024 you go to news.example where you are a subscriber and have provided your email address. Embedded on the website, dataBroker.example. The data broker has gleaned your email address from the login form and calls the Topics API to learn that you currently have these interests: In May 2026 you go to news.example where dataBroker.example calls the Topics API and is told that you now have these interests: Finally, in May 2029 you go to news.example where dataBroker.example calls the Topics API and is told that you have these interests: You haven’t told any website with access to your email address anything that’s been going on in your family life. But the data broker has been able to read your shifting interests and store them in their permanent profile of you — while you were reading the news. Now imagine what advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence can deduce about you based on various combinations of interest signals. What patterns will emerge when data brokers and trackers can compare and contrast across large portions of the population? Remember that they can combine the output of the Topics API with any other data points they have available, and it’s the analysis of all of it together that feeds the algorithms that try to draw conclusions about you. We think the web should not expose such information across websites and we don’t think the browser, i.e. the user agent, should facilitate any such data collection or use. Our defenses against cloaked third-party IP addresses and our partitioning of SessionStorage and blob URLs are enabled by default in both regular browsing and Private Browsing. Here’s how those protections work. In 2020, Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) gained the ability to cap the expiry of cookies set in third-party CNAME-cloaked HTTP responses to 7 days. This defense did not mitigate cases where IP aliasing is used to cloak third party requests under first party subdomains. ITP now also applies a 7-day cap to the expiry of cookies in responses from cloaked third-party IP addresses. Detection of third-party IP addresses is heuristic, and may change in the future. Currently, two IP addresses are considered different parties if any of the following criteria are met: Websites have many options for how they store information over longer time periods. Session Storage is a storage area in Safari that is scoped to the current tab. When a tab in Safari is closed, all of the session storage associated with it is destroyed.

Apple,Apple partners with leading chumbox provider to sell ads,https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199744/apple-news-stocks-apps-chumbox-ads-taboola,"By Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. Taboola, one of the biggest providers of chumbox ads on the internet, has a deal to sell ads that will show up in Apple’s News and Stocks apps, Axios reports. Apple lists Taboola as one of its “authorized advertising resellers” whose ads appear in the apps’ feeds and “select publisher articles” for users in the US, UK, Australia, and Canada. The deal doesn’t mean Apple News will soon be littered with chumboxes — those ad boxes formatted to look like news stories that you see at the bottom of articles (including at The Verge) with low-rent, often ridiculous clickbait headlines. Taboola makes those, and they apparently do quite well. But it also sells “native” ads, which are meant to blend in with surrounding content, from “a curated set of premium publishers” through its Taboola Select program, notes Axios. In the case of Apple, the company’s ad moderator team has “certain levels of control around which advertisers it will sell through to Apple apps,” Axios writes, paraphrasing Taboola CEO Adam Singolda. It’s not clear when Apple and Taboola made their deal, but the company has been listed on Apple’s site since at least May, according to The Internet Archive. It appears to have replaced Yahoo. NBCUniversal also sells ads that show up in Apple News and Apple Stocks, but only in the US and the UK. I took a quick jaunt through Apple News while writing this story, and you won’t BELIEVE the ads I saw IN JUST FIVE MINUTES! ... Normal ads. They were just regular, mundane ads. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly. The Verge is a vox media network © 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Apple,Apple and Metrolinx introduce PRESTO card for iPhone and Apple Watch,https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2024/07/apple-and-metrolinx-introduce-presto-card-for-iphone-and-apple-watch/,"Text of this article July 16, 2024 UPDATE Apple and Metrolinx introduce PRESTO card for iPhone and Apple Watch Customers can add a PRESTO card to Apple Wallet and simply tap their iPhone or Apple Watch to ride the subway, train, bus, and streetcar Apple and Metrolinx today introduced an easy, secure, and private way to tap to ride transit in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) using Apple Wallet on iPhone and Apple Watch. Within the Wallet app, customers can now add a new PRESTO card and add funds to ride transit throughout the GTHA.1 Riders can purchase and add funds to PRESTO in Wallet from the PRESTO app or directly from Wallet, and use an iPhone or Apple Watch to tap and ride. “We’re thrilled to bring PRESTO to Apple Wallet, enabling GTHA residents and visitors alike to securely and seamlessly use their iPhone or Apple Watch to ride transit,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. “Whether they’re commuting to work or exploring the city, PRESTO in Apple Wallet makes the transit experience easy and convenient.” Add PRESTO to Wallet and Reload on the Go Starting today, users can quickly and easily add a new PRESTO card to Wallet by opening the Wallet app, tapping the Add (+) button, selecting “Transit Card,” and following the instructions. Users can also add their registered physical PRESTO card to their iPhone or Apple Watch by selecting their card in the PRESTO app and following the onscreen instructions. With PRESTO in Wallet, users no longer need to reload their card at transit hubs or participating retailers. They can add funds from the PRESTO app or directly in Wallet. Users can also purchase passes such as TTC Monthly Pass from the PRESTO iOS app and add them to PRESTO in Wallet. Tap to Ride Using PRESTO in Wallet PRESTO in Wallet allows for an easy and convenient transit experience. With Express Mode enabled, a user can simply hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near a reader to ride transit in the GTHA without having to unlock or wake up their device.2 With power reserve on iPhone, if a customer’s device needs to be charged, they can still use it to ride transit.3 Tap to Ride with a Credit or Debit Card with Apple Pay If users prefer to pay as they go, they can also add their credit and debit cards4 to Apple Pay and simply tap their iPhone or Apple Watch to ride transit with Express Mode — with no need to unlock or even wake up their device. Security and Privacy PRESTO in Wallet takes full advantage of the privacy and security built into iPhone and Apple Watch. PRESTO cards stored in Wallet are private and secure, and Apple never tracks users’ journeys. When customers add a PRESTO card to Wallet, the card information is encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element, an industry-standard, certified chip designed to store the information safely on the device. If a user’s iPhone or Apple Watch is misplaced, the owner of the device can promptly use the Find My app to lock and help locate the device.

Apple,Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation,https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite,"I’m Marco Arment: a programmer, writer, podcaster, geek, and coffee enthusiast. July 16, 2024 ∞https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloading episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎ Marco.org RSS feed • @marcoarment on Mastodon I include Amazon Associate links to products I recommend.

Apple,Apple trained AI models on YouTube content without consent; includes MKBHD videos,https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/16/apple-used-youtube-videos/,"A number of tech giants, including Apple, trained AI models on YouTube videos without the consent of the creators, according to a new report today. They did this by using subtitle files downloaded by a third party from more than 170,000 videos. Creators affected include tech reviewer Marquees Brownlee (MKBHD), MrBeast, PewDiePie, Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, and Jimmy Kimmel … The subtitle files are effectively transcripts of the video content. Wired reports. An investigation by Proof News found some of the wealthiest AI companies in the world have used material from thousands of YouTube videos to train AI. Companies did so despite YouTube’s rules against harvesting materials from the platform without permission. Our investigation found that subtitles from 173,536 YouTube videos, siphoned from more than 48,000 channels, were used by Silicon Valley heavyweights, including Anthropic, Nvidia, Apple, and Salesforce. The downloads were reportedly performed by a non-profit called EleutherAI, which says it helps developers train AI models. While the aim appears to have been to provide training materials to small developers and academics, the dataset has also been used by several tech giants, including Apple. According to a research paper published by EleutherAI, the dataset is part of a compilation the nonprofit released called the Pile […] Most of the Pile’s datasets are accessible and open for anyone on the internet with enough space and computing power to access them. Academics and other developers outside of Big Tech made use of the dataset, but they weren’t the only ones. Apple, Nvidia, and Salesforce—companies valued in the hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars—describe in their research papers and posts how they used the Pile to train AI. Documents also show Apple used the Pile to train OpenELM, a high-profile model released in April, weeks before the company revealed it will add new AI capabilities to iPhones and MacBooks. Wired says Apple hadn’t responded to a request for comment at the time of writing. MKBHD subsequently put out a brief response video: Some think this was a privacy violation. It isn't. What was violated was the use of copyrighted content without authors's permission. Take YouTube host Marquees Brownlee. He earns income from the ads to his tech reviews. Suppose a major TV network were to copy his videos without his permission, broadcast them with ads, and not pay him income from those ads. That would be a flat-out copyright violation. That is covered by copyright law. The difficulty is that the existing copyright laws, as fixed in the Berne Convention, are based on broadcasting and publishing as they existed in 1971. Computers were mainframes owned by few. There was no Internet, no PCs, no smartphones, no YouTube, and no digital books. AI training has now joined that list. Judges have done their best to extend those early 1970s rules to modern circumstances, but the result is a mess. There is a principle at play. The copyright for content can be extended to other or ""derivative"" uses, say a movie or a computer game based on a novel. There the connection is obvious. Anyone who watches the movie The Hunt for Red October, knows it is based on a Tom Clancy novel. The problem comes when the links between the original and the derivative grow distant. AI, training on millions of words, is very distant indeed. Some say that extending copyright to that use goes too far. Some say it doesn't. Making matters worse, there is no black-and-white law defining what is covered by these over forty years of advances in technology. It’s important to emphasize here that Apple didn’t download the data itself, but this was instead performed by EleutherAI. It is this organization which appears to have broken YouTube’s terms and conditions. All the same, while Apple and the other companies named likely used a publicly-available dataset in good faith, it’s a good illustration of the legal minefield created by scraping the web to train AI systems. There have been multiple examples of AI systems plagiarizing entire paragraphs of text when asked about niche topics, and the dangers of using material without permission are only increased when companies use datasets compiled by third parties.

Apple,iPhone 16 Pro Again Rumored to Come in New 'Rose' Color,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/iphone-16-pro-rose-color-coming/,"Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be available in a new ""Rose"" color, claims a rumor out of China, corroborating previous claims. Chinese Weibo-based leaker OvO Baby Sauce OvO, a relatively new source of supply chain leaks, said on Tuesday that the new color code for the iPhone 16 Pro models is simply ""Rose,"" not the previous ""Rose Gold"" color that Apple first offered back in 2015 for the iPhone 6S. According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 16 Pro and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max are expected to be available in black, white or silver, gray or ""Natural Titanium,"" and rose. Kuo's prediction mirrored an earlier rumor from the same Weibo source, claiming that the existing Blue Titanium color will be dropped from the ‌‌iPhone 16 Pro‌‌ lineup in favor of a new ""rose"" titanium color. Meanwhile, Kuo believes the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus will apparently be offered in black, green, pink, blue, and white. The iPhone 15 and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus are available in black, green, pink, blue, and yellow. This means that white will replace yellow, with the colors remaining the same. Kuo mentioned that Apple might rename some of the existing colors, similar to how ""White"" on the iPhone 12 was changed to ""Starlight"" on the iPhone 13. Even if the color names remain the same, the actual tone and appearance might still differ. The ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup is anticipated to be announced in the fall.

Apple,TSMC 2nm processor won't arrive until the iPhone 18 Pro,https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/07/16/tsmc-2nm-processor-wont-arrive-until-the-iphone-18-pro,"AAPL: 226.68 ( +2.37 ) Copyright © 2024 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. TSMC is developing a 2nm process Despite previous reports that Apple's iPhone 17 Pro would get TSMC's latest 2nm processor, a new claim says mass production will not be ready until the end of 2025. As recently as April 2024, reports were saying that the new and faster 2 nanometer processors would be produced for Apple in 2025, and that they would appear first in the iPhone 17 Pro. TSMC did commit to a 2025 launch, but a new claim says that volume production will be too late for that year's iPhone launch. The claim comes a leaker called ""Mobile phone chip expert,"" on the Weibo Chinese social media site. The claim was in response to apparent industry media reports that chips made with the 2nm process would be ready in early 2025. ""This is nonsense fake news,"" writes the leaker (in translation), ""After reading the production capacity planning table, I know that this is another report by the unscrupulous media."" Then the leaker specifies that the iPhone 17 Pro will still use 3nm processors. And that the iPhone will not have 2nm until the iPhone 18 range. The industry report that the leaker hopes to refute also says that Apple's M5 processor is expected to be mass-produced in 2025. The leaker doesn't directly comment on this claim, and previous reports have said Apple is already working on that M5 chip. Leaker ""Mobile Phone Chip Expert"" has a generally good reputation for accuracy. However, most of his or her claims concern issues that will take years to confirm. They may also never be confirmed. For instance, a recent claim from the leaker says that Apple has a secret plan to develop AI processors for its data centers.

N2 production would need to start in the first half of 2025 for apple to get it into the 2025 iPhones. I had assumed that wouldn’t happen, but some other stories made it sound like it could. A combination of good luck and lots of money might make it happen. Though honestly I’m not sure why Apple would want to accelerate N2, except perhaps for the Mac so they can compete with Intel 20A and 18A. But for the iPhone, nobody will be on a more advanced mode than apple, so no need to rush. N2 production would need to start in the first half of 2025 for apple to get it into the 2025 iPhones.

To push the construction ahead of schedule would be prohibitively expensive, I imagine. Also, TSMC has not yet said where A16 (the TSMC 1.6 nm node, not the Apple SoC) will be implemented, but Fab 20 seems possible, it’s a large complex with four buildings.The big change in cadence is the apparent shift from two generations per node (basically a sort of tick-tock model) for N7-N7P, N5-N5P, N4-N4P to at least three main generations per node for N3-N3E-N3P, and N2-N2P/A16. The shift actually began with 5nm, with N4 (which is third-generation 5nm). So it’s hard to predict because it is obviously in flux as they transition to a new era, where advanced packaging is increasingly part of the equation. Definitely lots of money.
