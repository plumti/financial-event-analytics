Microsoft,NHS warns of more disruption to GP services after 8.5 million Windows devices hit by CrowdStrike IT outage,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/microsoft-says-crowdstrike-outage-hit-164051058.html,"The NHS has warned of “continued disruption” to GP services into next week after Microsoft revealed 8.5 million Windows devices were hit in a global IT outage. A flawed update rolled out by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike knocked millions offline around the world on Friday, grounding flights, crippling some healthcare systems and taking tv channels off air. Thousands of passengers had their travel plans cancelled when the botched software update hit Microsoft’s Windows operating system, with many travellers met with the “blue screen of death”. Across England, GP surgeries reported being unable to book appointments or access patient records on Friday as their EMIS appointment and patient record system went down. NHS England said on Saturday afternoon that its systems were “coming back online in most areas” but “still running slightly slower than usual”. An NHS spokesperson said: “As practices recover from the loss of IT systems on Friday, there may be some continued disruption, particularly to GP services, in some areas into next week as practices work to rebook appointments. “The advice for Monday remains that patients should attend appointments as normal unless told otherwise.” One GP told the BBC the IT outage meant “everything went down” in her surgery and the disruption would cause “a lot more issues later on in the week”.The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) said that patients collecting prescriptions could cause a backlog this weekend as pharmacies recover. Some 207 flights, equating to 6.7 per cent of all scheduled UK departures, were axed on Friday, with others delayed, while 201 flights due to land in the UK were cancelled. Aviation analytics company Cirium said 6,855 flights, or 6.2 per cent of all those scheduled, were cancelled globally on Friday. It added that 1,639 flights had been cancelled globally as of 10am on Saturday, including 23 flights departing from UK airports, equating to 0.9 per cent of all scheduled UK departures, as well as 25 arrivals into the UK. On Saturday the Port of Dover said it was dealing with “hundreds of displaced” airport passengers and urged customers to ensure they had a booking before arrival. Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said on Saturday afternoon that the IT systems of UK airports and train operators were “back up and working as normal”, but “some delays and a small number of cancelled flights” were expected. Travellers at Heathrow Airport were experiencing long queues on Saturday morning and reported problems with checking in for British Airways flights. Long check-in queues could also be seen at Gatwick Airport on Saturday. Passengers reportedly struggled to buy tickets at London Waterloo station on Saturday morning.Elsewhere at London Paddington, QR code scanners stopped working, leaving ticket inspectors with no choice but to let passengers off the platforms, the MailOnline reported. Less than one per cent of all Windows machines were affected during the outage, Microsoft said in a blog post, but “while the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services.” CrowdStrike chief executive George Kurtz apologised, saying he is “deeply sorry” and made clear it was “not a security or cyber incident”. In a technical statement, CrowdStrike said a “sensor configuration” had “triggered a logic error” which the company said had been corrected. It has been confirmed that the glitch affected 8.5 million Windows devices ""We currently estimate that CrowdStrike's update affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or less than one percent of all Windows machines,"" it said in the blog. A software update by global cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, one of the largest operators in the industry, triggered systems problems that grounded flights, forced broadcasters off air and left customers without access to services such as healthcare or banking.

Microsoft,Microsoft Defends Xbox Game Pass Price Increase Amid FTC Criticism,https://gameinfinitus.com/game-news/microsoft-defends-xbox-game-pass-price-increase-amid-ftc-criticism/,"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has recently expressed concerns regarding the recent price adjustments and modifications to Xbox Game Pass subscriptions, highlighting potential consumer issues. In response, Microsoft has defended these changes, asserting that they are beneficial for gamers. The FTC criticized Microsoft’s decision to discontinue Game Pass for Console, noting that users would face a substantial price hike to transition to Game Pass Ultimate. The FTC referred to the new Game Pass Standard as a “degraded product,” emphasizing that it costs 36% more and excludes day-one releases. According to the FTC, this exemplifies the consumer harm they had cautioned against during Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Furthermore, the FTC argued that these price increases contradict Microsoft’s previous pledges. They cited Microsoft’s statements during the Xbox FTC trial, where the company assured that the acquisition would benefit consumers by offering Call of Duty on Game Pass without any price hikes. In response to these allegations, Microsoft stated that the FTC’s assertions are misleading. The company emphasized that the new Game Pass Standard offers back-catalog games and multiplayer functionality, whereas the discontinued Game Pass for Console lacked multiplayer features. Microsoft also asserted that the higher price of Game Pass Ultimate is justified by its inclusion of new games on their release day. Microsoft criticized the FTC for focusing on the potential withholding of Call of Duty from Sony consoles, a theory dismissed by the district court. The company highlighted a contract ensuring that Call of Duty remains available on PlayStation. Additionally, Microsoft argued that the acquisition of Activision Blizzard King benefits competition and consumers, as established by the district court’s findings. With the recent changes to Xbox Game Pass, there has been a price hike along with adjustments to the subscription tiers. While PC Game Pass remains unchanged, offering day-one games, Xbox Game Pass for Consoles has been downgraded. Customers now need to upgrade to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to enjoy Microsoft games on their release day.

Microsoft,"CrowdStrike’s faulty update crashed 8.5 million Windows devices, says Microsoft",https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/20/24202527/crowdstrike-microsoft-windows-bsod-outage,"By Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. CrowdStrike’s faulty update caused a worldwide tech disaster that affected 8.5 million Windows devices on Friday, according to Microsoft. Microsoft says that’s “less than one percent of all Windows machines,” but it was enough to create problems for retailers, banks, airlines, and many other industries, as well as everyone who relies on them. Separately, the technical breakdown from CrowdStrike released Friday explains more about what happened and why so many systems were affected all at once. CrowdStrike’s breakdown explains the configuration file that was at the heart of the issue: The configuration files mentioned above are referred to as “Channel Files” and are part of the behavioral protection mechanisms used by the Falcon sensor. Updates to Channel Files are a normal part of the sensor’s operation and occur several times a day in response to novel tactics, techniques, and procedures discovered by CrowdStrike. This is not a new process; the architecture has been in place since Falcon’s inception. CrowdStrike explained that the file is not a kernel driver but is responsible for “how Falcon evaluates named pipe1 execution on Windows systems.” Security researcher and Objective See founder Patrick Wardle says that the explanation aligns with the earlier analysis he and others provided about the cause of the crash, as the problem file “C-00000291- “triggered a logic error that resulted in an OS crash” (via CSAgent.sys).” Other excerpts from CrowdStrike’s blog explain more about what went wrong: On July 19, 2024 at 04:09 UTC, as part of ongoing operations, CrowdStrike released a sensor configuration update to Windows systems. Sensor configuration updates are an ongoing part of the protection mechanisms of the Falcon platform. This configuration update triggered a logic error resulting in a system crash and blue screen (BSOD) on impacted systems. And which systems were affected and when: Systems running Falcon sensor for Windows 7.11 and above that downloaded the updated configuration from 04:09 UTC to 05:27 UTC – were susceptible to a system crash. CrowdStrike’s channel file updates were pushed to computers regardless of any settings meant to prevent such automatic updates, Wardle noted. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Microsoft,CrowdStrike tech outage shows the precarious nature of our digital world,https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/crowdstrike-global-outage-fragile-world-it-system-3179380,"Mon 22 Jul 2024 @ Contact us Your newsletters Train stations. Airports. Television stations. Stock exchanges. Banks. Emergency services. The world has ground to a halt thanks to an unexpected outage to a system designed to keep computers from harm this morning. As people in the UK woke up, they were confronted by blank blue screens. The purported cause was a faulty update with a security system operated by CrowdStrike, a third-party company, that was pushed out to users worldwide. And while the inability to turn on your laptop or computer is frustrating for individuals, the offline impact of the digital incident is enormous. Michael Veale was set to fly out of Heathrow this morning, but encountered issues as he tried to go through security. “Only one scanner was working due to a computer crash,” he said. “As I left to the gate, all the departure screens were showing ‘Recovery Mode’. As I got onto the plane and the runway, Berlin airport closed.” Veale, a computer science expert who is an associate professor at University College London, spoke to i from his plane seat, stuck on the runway at Heathrow. He had been told by the pilot that the plane was experiencing a two-hour delay and they hoped Berlin airport would soon reopen, but was told mid-conversation that the flight had been cancelled. Veale explained that the issue highlights our over-reliance on individual software providers for security of key infrastructure. “As companies try to control their computers on-the-cheap, they turn to third-party software providers that they give deep control over their infrastructure to. “Modern software development is all about giving centralised, remote control of what code is running on your device to companies like CrowdStrike and Microsoft. When this goes wrong, as we have seen, everything goes wrong. We’re building a dangerous digital monoculture, and just like agricultural monocultures, these are very susceptible to blight and disease.” It’s a concern echoed by other cyber security experts. “This proves our IT infrastructure is fragile,” said Eerke Boiten, a cyber security professor at De Montfort University. “Probably too many organisations are in a position where their actions can break a lot – even if unintentional.” CrowdStrike is a large, US-based company that provides cyber security services to companies around the world. One of its major services is Falcon Sensor, a tool that runs in the background of Microsoft Windows and tracks data flows to and from internet-connected devices. Indications suggest that the issue is a problem with Falcon Sensor. As computers that use the Falcon Sensor system update to the latest version, cyber security experts suggest that error has prevented computers running the Windows operating system that have CrowdStrike services installed from starting up. The problem appears to be that an individual file, which was updated overnight, was misconfigured, which causes Windows to refuse to start. It’s the computer equivalent of a small mechanical error in a motor preventing a vehicle from starting up. There are no suggestions that the issue has been caused by a malicious actor, but rather a mistake that, because of CrowdStrike’s ubiquity – it is one of the world’s most widely-used protection systems – multiplies across different areas, from supermarket checkouts to airline routing systems. Indeed the CEO of CrowdStrike, George Kurtz, said: “This is not a security incident or cyber attack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.” He added that the company is “actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts”. Microsoft said a resolution for Windows devices was “forthcoming”. Nevertheless, the impacts have been significant. Some have reported their devices were switching off as they were on Zoom calls, leaving them unable to restart their computer. There are workarounds, including starting up devices in safe mode and changing which CrowdStrike files are run at the point a device starts up, but most people are best to wait for an update. The issue is a black eye for CrowdStrike, which seeks to solve problems and protect users, rather than cause problems. “This incident shows that while distributed security solutions can help an organisation respond quickly to a threat, if the very tool protecting you causes an error the impact is fast and widespread,” said Alan Woodward, professor of cyber security at the University of Surrey. “It shows just how vital IT has become to the operation of a whole range of organisations. Lose your IT and you can’t function.” The silver lining is that because so many aspects of our lives have been affected, the relevant companies who can fix the problem – CrowdStrike in particular – are working fast to remedy the issue. Yet while the incident is likely to be resolved today with a new automated update that winds us back to before the issue appeared, the outage will raise awareness of the precarious nature of our world and its reliance on technology – and quite how quickly things went wrong will act as a cautionary tale for next time. While it’s impossible to iron out human errors, it’s likely we’ll see even more oversight going forward. “We don’t often get reminders of [how reliant we are on single services], fortunately,” said Boiten.

Microsoft,Microsoft D&I cuts impact two positions —  company says main team and larger goals remain intact,https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsoft-di-cuts-impact-two-positions-company-says-main-team-and-larger-goals-remain-intact/,"by Todd Bishop on July 18, 2024 at 8:53 amJuly 18, 2024 at 2:42 pm Reports of D&I’s death at Microsoft are greatly exaggerated. That’s the gist of the company’s response to a media snowball effect that misinterpreted the elimination of two diversity and inclusion roles on its events team — yes, two positions — as the axing of its entire diversity and inclusion team. For the record, Microsoft says, that larger corporate D&I team remains intact. It’s formally known as the Microsoft Global Talent, Development, Diversity and Inclusion (GTDDI) team, led by Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, chief diversity officer. Business Insider reported in its original story July 15 that Microsoft laid off “a DEI team,” noting that the number of impacted employees wasn’t known at the time. Subsequent reports, citing the Business Insider story, said Microsoft was “the latest major company to ditch the ‘woke’ policy,” and that the company “laid off the entirety of its diversity, equity and inclusion team.” In that way, the company was viewed as part of a trend with others such as John Deere and Tractor Supply Co., which have significantly scaled back or eliminated diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in recent weeks. However, Microsoft says the reports mischaracterize what’s it’s doing. The company provided this statement, reiterating what it said to other publications: “As we move forward, our D&I commitments remain unchanged. Our focus on diversity and inclusion is unwavering and we are holding firm on our expectations, prioritizing accountability, and continuing to focus on this work.” The two roles that were cut on its events team were duplicated on the main GTDDI team, and did not report into that core D&I group. Microsoft declined to say how many people are on the GTDDI team. Big picture, Microsoft has continued to make job cuts across the company, most recently in early July, following the end of its fiscal year. The company is trying to maintain its profit margins amid heavier capital spending, which is designed to provide the cloud infrastructure needed to train and deploy the models that power AI applications. “The work of D&I has always been complex, yet this year presented unique challenges,” McIntyre wrote in Microsoft’s 2023 Global Diversity & Inclusion Report. “Macro economic headwinds impacted many organizations, and we had to make difficult workforce adjustments inside Microsoft that reduced headcount, particularly in the US.” Several years ago, Microsoft joined other companies in pledging to make new investments in diversity initiatives following the 2020 protests over the murder of George Floyd, and the Black Lives Matter movement. The initiatives have since come under pressure across the business and political worlds. Business Insider quoted a memo from a leader of the Microsoft team impacted by the cuts, saying, “True systems-change work associated with DEI programs everywhere are no longer business critical or smart as they were in 2020.” A column in Inc. notes that Microsoft isn’t using the word “equity,” consistent with a broader trend to emphasize “inclusion first.” Microsoft has reported its diversity numbers for many years using the phrase “Diversity & Inclusion.” Subscribe to GeekWire's free newsletters to catch every headline Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?
