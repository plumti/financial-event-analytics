Apple,https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/07/17/imessage-patent-row-between-apple-and-mph-revived-with-new-subpoena,"AAPL: 228.88 ( -5.94 ) Copyright © 2024 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. Messages on an iPhone Apple is fighting to make litigation funding firm Omni Bridgeway comply with a subpoena, demanding details about its relationship with MPH, a company Apple is in a patent lawsuit with over iMessage and FaceTime. Back in 2018, Finnish holdings firm MPH Technologies sued Apple over allegations the iPhone maker infringed its patents. In the latest event of the long-running lawsuit, Apple is trying to get information about MPH from a company allegedly funding the lawsuit. The patent lawsuit itself claimed that Apple infringed on IP for sending and forwarding messages over a secure connection. Apple's software affected by the suit includes iMessage, FaceTime, and an always-on VPN feature that's part of a mobile device management (MDM) solution. MPH had previously tried and failed to convince Apple to license its technology in 2016. The lawsuit died down for quite some time as Apple challenged the patents using the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, but it was revived in 2023. Reuters reports a new trial is scheduled for April 2025. More funding details, please In the case's revival, Apple had demanded details of any communications between MPH and third parties, including lawsuit funders, about the supposed patents and infringement. It was the belief that any doubts from third parties over the value of the patents would help Apple's case. MPH declined to provide the information, insisting that agreements with third-party funding sources would be irrelevant and that Apple's request was too broad. In June, a U.S. magistrate judge agreed with MPH, declining Apple's request. However, Apple was instructed to work with MPH on discovery disputes. However, in December, Apple quietly decided to go another route, subpoenaing Omni Bridgeway. The subpoena demanded documents and testimony about Omni Bridgeway's relationship with MPH. Reuters says there's no clear reason for Apple to believe Omni Bridgeway was involved in the case since those details are under seal. Omni Bridgeway did raise a number of objections to the subpoena, including how the demand was vague and sought information that was privileged. Sideways access By July, Apple tried to compel Omni Bridgeway to comply with the subpoena. However, rather than going through the San Francisco-based court and the existing MPH-Apple case, Apple did so in Delaware, where Omni Bridgeway is based. After the case was assigned to a Delaware judge, Omni Bridgeway moved to transfer the subpoena case to the same judge handling the Apple-MPH case. The Delaware officiant, U.S. District Judge Colm Connoly, requires litigants to disclose relationships to outside backers and if they have a say in legal strategy. Naturally, Apple has opposed the transfer from a potentially friendly judge, citing Omni's headquarters being located in the state. Omni, meanwhile, insists that the same San Francisco court should hear the main lawsuit. Judge Connolly has yet to rule on the matter.

Apple,https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/07/17/microsoft-designer-brings-ai-image-generation-to-iphone-before-apple-intelligence,"AAPL: 228.88 ( -5.94 ) Copyright © 2024 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. Microsoft Designer Last updated 17 hours ago Microsoft Designer, a generative AI tool that produces images, has left preview and is now available as a free iOS app. Previously available in preview for close to a year, Microsoft Designer has finally become available to everyone. Trialled using Microsoft Edge and other browsers through a website, Designer is now open to use on more platforms, including apps for iOS, Android, and Windows. The app itself is free, but requires a Microsoft account to sign in and use. Previously, elements have been available through Copilot in Microsoft's other apps, including Word. Designer follows the typical usage patterns of generative AI systems that produce images. Users can make a text prompt, which is used to create the image, but there are also templates to make it easier to create social media images and greetings cards, for example. Along with creating new images, the app also has an avatar creation feature, and options to edit existing pictures. The latter includes tools to remove or change backgrounds and objects within the scene, or to entirely restyle the picture. Though free to download, users will be limited to 15 ""boosts"" each day, which are automatically consumed when AI-based changes are made to images. Users could upgrade to a $20 Copilot Pro subscription to get 100 boosts per day. Microsoft's launch of Designer arrives as the world waits for Apple to introduce Apple Intelligence in its betas, ahead of the fall release. Apple's system includes a generative AI image tool titled Image Playground to create images based on prompts. Like Microsoft's implementation, the Apple Intelligence version also has hooks into various Apple apps, so you can easily insert generated images. It can now be downloaded from Apple's App Store.

Apple,https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/19/iphone-se-4-likely-to-use-iphone-16-chassis/,"Apple will adopt the same rear chassis manufacturing process for the iPhone SE 4 that it is using for the upcoming standard iPhone 16, claims a new rumor coming out of China. According to the Weibo-based leaker ""Fixed Focus Digital,"" the backplate manufacturing process for the iPhone SE 4 is ""exactly the same"" as the standard model in Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 lineup, which is expected to be released in September. The iPhone SE 4, meanwhile, is expected to arrive in the spring. The latest claim casts doubt on a previous rumor suggesting Apple would use a modified iPhone 14 chassis as the basis for a fourth-generation iPhone SE. In November 2023, MacRumors learned from a source close to Apple's manufacturing process that the dimensions of the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 ""perfectly matched"" those of the base model ‌iPhone 14 in its current stage‌. While it's still unclear what may have led to the change, it's possible that Apple chose to adopt its newer rear chassis process for the more affordable SE model to achieve economy of scale at the point of production as the manufacture of iPhone 14 models winds down towards retirement. However, it could also indicate a change to the camera system on the fourth-generation iPhone SE. Unlike the ‌iPhone 14‌, the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 was previously rumored to include a single 48-megapixel rear camera with a custom backplate for the device to account for the design change. In contrast, for the iPhone 16 models, Apple is planning a new vertical camera lens arrangement that is a departure from the diagonal lens setup found on iPhone 15 models. The new orientation will presumably allow the standard iPhone 16 models to capture Spatial Video for the Vision Pro headset. Adopting the same backplate for the iPhone SE 4 would seem to suggest it will feature the same dual camera setup, although we haven't heard any rumors specifically claiming that this is in Apple's plans. Apple is said to be targeting a sub-$500 starting price for its fourth-generation iPhone SE model, despite a raft of rumored upgrades coming to the more affordable device. Touch ID and the Home button will be replaced by Face ID and a display notch, while the display size will increase from 4.7 inches to 6.1 inches. Other features expected for the next iPhone SE include a USB-C port and an Action button. The third-generation iPhone SE was released in March 2022, so there is likely pent-up demand for a new model that includes some of the latest features of Apple's flagship iPhone models.
